	abstract = {The postponement of fertility has been observed in Czechia since the beginning of the 1990s. This paper employed a mixed-method approach that focused on the various reasons for unplanned postponement. The survey data describes the quantity of the occurrence of unplanned postponement for declared reasons, while the in-depth interviews serve to describe the relationships between the stated reasons. The qualitative research confirms the expectation of the sequential characteristics of postponement; at younger ages, individually-motivated reasoning was found to be common, followed by partner-motivated reasoning and, finally, by health-motivated reasoning. Additionally, individually-motivated reasoning represents the postponement due to the re-evaluation of a plan, while partner-motivated and health-motivated reasoning can be considered as unplanned postponement.

	abstract = {Abstract: In this study, we examine the effects of the economic uncertainty of partners on the transition to first birth in Greece before and after the onset of the recent economic crisis. After selecting a sample of childless couples, we applied a random effects model to EU-SILC data for the period 2005–2013. Few studies have focused on the association between economic uncertainty and fertility in Greece considering characteristics of both partners. Even fewer studies have examined panel data in the context of the recent crisis. Our findings show that Greek couples in which both partners are employed, have a high income, or are highly educated are in a more favourable position to have a first child. During the Greek Great Recession, corresponding in our study to the period 2010–2013, the odds of having a first child decreased to half the odds in the 2005–2009 period. The recession period also modified the effect of couples’ characteristics on first childbearing. During the economic crisis, male breadwinner couples were particularly penalized in their transition to have a first child. Surprisingly, couples with at least one temporary worker, usually the woman, were encouraged to have their first child. Implications in terms of gender and social inequality are discussed in the concluding section, and selection processes at play are also discussed.

	abstract = {Understanding migration patterns and how they change over time has important implications for understanding broader population trends, effectively designing policy and allocating resources. However, data on migration movements are often lacking, and those that do exist are not produced in a timely manner. Social media data offer new opportunities to provide more up-to-date demographic estimates and to complement more-traditional data sources. Facebook, for example, can be thought of as a large digital census that is regularly updated. However, its users are not representative of the underlying population, thus using the data without appropriate adjustments would lead to biased results. This chapter discusses the use of social media advertising data to estimate migration over time. A statistical framework for combining traditional data sources and the social media data is presented, which emphasizes the importance of three main components: adjusting for non-representativeness in the social media data; incorporating historical information from reliable demographic data; and accounting for different errors in each data source. The framework is illustrated through an example that uses data from Facebook’s advertising platform to estimate migrant stocks in North America. © Mark Birkin, Graham Clarke, Jonathan Corcoran and Robert Stimson 2021.},

	abstract = {An extensive literature theorizes the role of repartnering for cohort fertility and whether union dissolution can be an engine for fertility. A large share of higher order unions are nonmarital cohabitations, but most previous studies on completed cohort fertility have analyzed only marital unions, and none have incorporated non-marital cohabitations using population-level data. To analyze the relationship between the number of unions and cohort fertility for men and women, we use Poisson regres-sion with Finnish register data to enumerate every birth, marriage, and cohabitation among the 1969–1972 birth cohorts at ages 18–46. We show that dissolutions of first cohabitations are the main pathway to repartnering and that most higher order unions are cohab i ta tions. Nonmarital repartnering is a strong pre dic tor of low fer til ity. In contrast, remarriage is positively associated with cohort fertility. Because the bulk of first-union dissolutions and higher order unions are nonmarital, repartnering is not an efficient engine for fertility at the aggregate level. Marriage and cohabitation are far from indistinguishable in a country often described as a second demographic transition forerunner. © 2022 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Our legal system characterizes the unborn in a multiplicity of conflicting ways-from persons to property, from body parts to medical investments. The law of civil wrongs is instructive. It weighs in when misconduct deprives aspiring parents of the child they had hoped to have, whether the transgression takes place during pregnancy or before it. The torts and remedies that govern these cases are riddled with a confusion that comes from treating prenatal life as anything but coherent. The overturning of Roe v. Wade has cast new light on the neglected doctrine of reproductive loss and deepened a tension about the meaning of prenatal life in both private and public law. This Article undertakes the first study of jury verdicts for mismanaged pregnancies and mishandled embryos. This original empirical analysis reveals wildly erratic outcomes. And it lends insight into the influence of racial and class biases about “wanted” children and “deserving” parents. We introduce a framework with which juries should appraise these losses according to three factors. First is the subjective experience of losing a wanted baby. Second is the objective chance of having that baby if not for misconduct. Third is accompanying traumas, such as delivering a dead baby in a stillbirth. Each factor operates to promote reproductive justice and recover principle in how the law treats prenatal death across the landscape of civil awards and criminal restrictions. © 2023, Dov Fox & Jill Wieber Lens.},

	abstract = {The share of childless people in contemporary Czech society (and elsewhere) is increasing. Research in the social sciences has mainly focused on explaining female rather than male childlessness. This article tries to at least partially fill in the gap in this research by focusing on male childlessness from the perspective of masculinities and more specifically hegemonic masculinity. A thematic analysis of problem-oriented interviews conducted repeatedly with 12 heterosexual men (of different ages and educational backgrounds) focuses on explaining these men's life experience of childlessness and their perception of childlessness in relation to the conditions and circumstances of their lives, and it does this in relation to how they construct their masculinities along the main axes of 'values and norms', 'the perception and meaning of close relationships', 'the meaning of work and leisure activities', and 'individuals' experience of their life situation'. Hegemonic masculinity characteristics are then either reproduced or disrupted according to how these different axes combine. The analysis has shown that, even in the case of childlessness, men more often construct their masculinities in a hegemonic than a non-hegemonic mode. However, hegemonic masculinity is also constructed through what is left 'unspoken' and 'concealed', that is, through what men do not explicitly state in interviews, so attention should also be paid to this issue in research on masculinities. © 2020 Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Institute of Sociology.

Building from Jay Dolmage’s concept of “disability drift,” I demonstrate how anti-trans activists channel other social anxieties into transphobia. Arguments about ROGD frame trans people as infinitesimally rare and as threats to all other communities, but these claims rely on the same narratives used to stigmatize mental illness, to dehumanize people of color and queer people, and to police the bodies and behavior of cisgender women. Introducing the concept of “affective drift,” I consider how ROGD rhetorics draw from ableism, racism, and heteronormativity to fuel transphobia and vise versa. In direct opposition to the logics of ROGD, then, I propose that rhetorical studies is equipped to foster connections across contrived social divides, and to enact solidarity in one another’s struggles. © 2022 The Rhetoric Society of America.},

Women and men who previously experienced intimate partner violence were no more likely to enter parenthood by age 25 than those individuals who had not previously experienced intimate partner violence. Further, prior IPV experience was not associated with an increased probability of unintended parenthood.

We assessed the relationship between fertility knowledge and gender and the experience of future life planning, among other factors. We found that fertility knowledge varied. Participants possessed a relatively good knowledge of the relationships between fertility and female ageing, and smoking, but limited knowledge about the effect of sexually transmitted infections on fertility. Male participants answered more correctly than female participants (p < 0.01) regarding ‘sperm production’; however, female respondents answered more accurately than male respondents (p < 0.01) regarding 'timing of menopause. In Japan, the national curriculum standard for upper secondary schools was revised in 2018, and fertility was added to the Health and Physical Education curriculum.

This article examines how “male-mediated transgenerational effects” are addressed by the discretionary, risk-based approach to chemical assessment enabled under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999. Informed by Cynthia Daniels' theory of reproductive masculinity, the authors critically examine recent assessments of two classes of everyday toxics ubiquitous in Canadian households—phthalates and brominated flame retardants.** In failing to give weight to emerging evidence of male-mediated transgenerational effects, these assessments arguably reproduce gendered assumptions, situating men as secondary to reproduction and reinforcing the idea that responsibility for toxic exposures is a maternal matter. The authors argue that Canadian governance of endocrine-disrupting chemicals would be improved by greater attention to how men's exposures to toxic chemicals may contribute to male-mediated transgenerational effects. Further, the article identifies deficiencies in the legislative scheme that contribute to ongoing failures to meaningfully assess or regulate endocrine-disrupting chemicals. © 2019 University of Toronto Press Inc..

This narrative review aims to assess sex and gender differences in occupational risks among workers. We point out that female workers are more exposed to biological risks (i.e., 70% of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic were women), but also seem to be more protected against microorganisms (i.e., for HBV vaccination: OR 1.21, p = 0.0023); with regard to physical risks, women are more susceptible to radiations (the estimated incidence of solid tu-mors for 0.1 Gy of exposure is 0.013% in females and 0.008% in males), while men are more susceptible to heat (infertility prevalence was 22.7% in exposed workers vs 3.0% in con-trols); female video terminal workers are more susceptible to both computer vision syndrome (aOR 2.57 and aOR 2.35) and musculoskeletal symptoms (OR 3.6). From a psychological point of view, women are more at risk for work-relat-ed stress and burnout, as well as workplace mobbing (65% of affected workers are women) and verbal violence, while physical violence was more common among men. In conclu-sion, important sex and gender differences are present with regard to occupational risks and hazards, thus showing the necessity to improve medical surveillance and to allow occupational physicians to personalize health surveillance. © 2022, Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore s.r.l..

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Many industrialized societies have experienced increases in life expectancy and in the mean age at first birth (MAFB). This has likely impacted the lifetime that parents share with their children; i.e., parenthood expectancy (PEX). OBJECTIVE With increasing life expectancy contributing positively to PEX and increasing MAFB leading to a reduction in the time spent as an ever-parent, our goal is to study how PEX for both men and women has been affected in different countries over time. METHODS Using harmonized fertility and mortality data for women and men in 37 countries, we provide PEX estimates from a period perspective. By means of counterfactual analyses, we study the extent to which each of the two components was responsible for the observed national trends in PEX. RESULTS PEX varies between 50–58 years for women and tends to be up to 10 years shorter for men. While for mothers the effects of increasing MAFB and life expectancy almost cancel each other out, PEX for men would have been more heavily affected by stagnation in survival conditions. CONCLUSIONS For most countries and both sexes, PEX has been increasing over the observational period. However, trends in PEX over time are strongly country-specific and depend on the onset of fertility postponement relative to gains in life expectancy. © 2023 Erich Striessnig & Alessandra Trimarchi.},

	abstract = {Partnering behavior is central to understanding fertility. Influential concepts, including singlehood, serial monogamy, and multiple-partner fertility, are frequently used to analyze partnering and childbearing dynamics. These concepts are evoked to understand individual and population-level patterns but are mainly analyzed at the individual level. We propose a measure for gauging the interplay between partnerships and childbearing at the population level, namely cohort fertility rates (CFR) as the sum of births under various partnership contexts. Surprisingly, demographers rarely measure and do not have a clear picture of the extent to which childbearing in different partnership contexts contributes to completed fertility. We analyze Finnish register data to decompose CFR into births across union status, union order, and reproductive partner order. Contrary to the discourse of partnering in the Nordics, births within first unions to first reproductive partners account for about two-thirds of CFR. Births in higher-order unions to first reproductive partners account for one-fifth. Single births and births with higher-order reproductive partners have a modest impact. This ranking holds across sex and educational level. We argue that the proposed measures offer a novel appraisal of population-level implications of partnerships and childbearing dynamics and provide an opportunity to understand cross-country variation in fertility patterns. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {It is well known that migrant fertility is associated with age at migration, but little is known about this relationship for forced migrants. We study an example of displacement in which the entire population of Finnish Karelia was forced to move elsewhere in Finland in the 1940s. This displacement was unique because of its size and scale, because we have data on almost the whole population of both men and women who moved, and because of the similarity between origin and destination. These aspects enable us to investigate the disruptive impact of forced migration, net of other factors such as adaptation and selection. For all ages at migration from one to 20, female forced migrants had lower levels of completed fertility than similar women born in present-day Finland, which suggests a permanent impact of migration. However, women born in the same year as the initial forced migration showed no difference, which may indicate the presence of a counterbalancing fertility-increasing effect, as observed elsewhere for people born during a humanitarian crisis. There is less evidence of an impact for men, which suggests a gendered impact of forced migration—and its timing—on fertility. Results are similar after controlling for social and spatial mobility, indicating that there may be no major trade-off between reproduction and these forms of mobility. © 2022 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Fathers’ multiple-partner fertility (MPF) is associated with substantially worse educational outcomes for children. We focus on children in fathers’ second fami lies that are nuclear: households consisting of a man, a woman, their joint children, and no other children. We analyze outcomes for almost 75,000 Norwegian children, all of whom lived in nuclear families until at least age 18. Children with MPF fathers are more likely than other children from nuclear families to drop out of secondary school (24% vs. 17%) and less likely to obtain a bachelor’s degree (44% vs. 51%). These gaps remain substantial—at 4 and 5 percentage points, respectively—after we control for child and parental characteristics, such as income, wealth, education, and age. Resource com­pe­ti­tion with the chil­dren in the father’s first fam­ily does not explain the dif­ferences in edu­ca­tional out­comes. We find that the asso­ci­a­tion between a father’s pre­vi­ous childless marriage and his children’s educational outcomes is similar to that between a father’s MPF and his chil­dren’s edu­ca­tional out­comes. Birth order does not explain these results.

In this study, we examine what 16- to 18-year-olds in England have learnt and their views about reproductive health education. Design: This is a mixed-methods study. An anonymous, online survey was conducted on Qualtrics software using multiple-choice and open-ended questions. Schools were recruited via the Biotutors forum, and they distributed the survey to students aged 16–18 years. Setting: Data collection took place across England. Methods: A total of 931 students completed the survey, of whom 636 were girls, 250 were boys, 31 as other genders, and 14 did not disclose their gender. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively, and associations were explored using Chi-square tests. Qualitative data were analysed thematically. Results: Over half (65%) of the students rated the sex education they had received as adequate or below. Over half (74%) reported that they do not, or only sometimes, talk to their parents/guardians about these topics. Half (49%) did not know when a woman is most fertile. Students showed a better knowledge of female fertility than male fertility. There was no relationship between how much teaching respondents said they had received and their knowledge of reproductive health topics. From the free text question ‘How do you think we can improve sex and fertility education in schools?’, five themes were identified: inclusivity for all students; comprehensive with relevant topic variety; logistical improvements needed to teaching; the need for honest, transparent and non-judgemental teaching; and sex positivity. Conclusion: Schools should teach a wider range of issues relevant to sexual and reproductive health.

Men and women not only have distinct roles of fathers and mothers, but also perform those roles according to norms of masculinity and femininity. Recently, however, such distinctions are converging. Fathers are no longer the distant male breadwinner of the past; they are now aligned with stereotypically feminine traits of caring, gentleness, and involvement in the “new, nurturant” fatherhood. While cultural images abound, there is little understanding of how individuals themselves make sense of parenting. I explore such understanding using the case of infertility. To do so, I compare men’s definitions of fatherhood to women’s conceptions of motherhood, revealing the significance of gender to their meaning-making. Indeed, even with shifting social ideologies, important gender differences in parenting remain. Through interviews with white, high-income individuals in the US who are struggling with their reproduction (n = 43), I find that nurturing is at the center of women’s understandings of motherhood in which self-sacrifice is prominent. In contrast, men distance themselves from this caretaker role by constructing their time spent with children in masculine ways. In other words, men leave the “nurturing” to women and have redefined the nurturant father to maintain parenting as gendered. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Fertility and lifestyle have therefore become seemingly intertwined. Esmée Sinéad Hanna and Brendan Gough examine men's experiences of fertility and lifestyle practices, exploring personal experiences of the role of lifestyle in the quest for conception as well as the broader promotion of 'lifestyle' within both clinical and online material as a key aspect for 'improving' male fertility. Through the exploration of male fertility and lifestyle factors and their modification we examine the growth of healthism around infertility, the role of neoliberalism within this and how this intersects with masculinity. Using a new notion of liquid masculinity, we explore the fluid nature of societal and personal perspectives on the male infertility experience. In doing so we offer new insights into the now accepted idea that 'sperm' is malleable and that fertility controllable through personal choices, despite their being limited scientific evidence for such claims. © 2022 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper examines differences in the risk of experiencing a nonmarital first birth between children of immigrants and children of native-born Americans. Results from the longitudinal data and event history models show that children of immigrants are less likely to have a nonmarital first birth compared to children of native-born Americans. A range of demographic and mitigating factors drive these nonmarital fertility patterns but do not fully account for the differences.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Previous kinship models analyze female kin through female lines of descent, neglecting male kin and male lines of descent. Because males and females differ in mortality and fertility, including both sexes in kinship models is an important unsolved problem. OBJECTIVE The objectives are to develop a kinship model including female and male kin through all lines of descent, to explore approximations when full sex-specific rates are unavailable, and to apply the model to several populations as an example. METHODS The kin of a focal individual form an age×sex-classified population and are projected as Focal ages using matrix methods, providing expected age-sex structures for every type of kin at every age of Focal. Initial conditions are based on the distribution of ages at maternity and paternity. RESULTS The equations for two-sex kinship dynamics are presented. As an example, the model is applied to populations with large (Senegal), medium (Haiti), and small (France) differences between female and male fertility. Results include numbers and sex ratios of kin as Focal ages. An approximation treating female and male rates as identical provides some insight into kin numbers, even when male and female rates are very different. CONTRIBUTION Many demographic and sociological parameters (e.g., aspects of health, bereavement, labor force participation) differ markedly between the sexes. This model permits analysis of such parameters in the context of kinship networks. The matrix formulation makes it possible to extend the two-sex analysis to include kin loss, multistate kin demography, and time varying rates. © 2022 Ryohei Mogi & Bruno Arpino.},

Currently, child mortality is at its lowest level in human history. While more children are living to post reproductive age, approximately 15% of couples are experiencing infecundity. This is either a result of one or both members of the couple being infecund, or, despite both being fecund, the interaction between them prevents fertility for some reason. Assisted reproductive technologies have provided many infertile couples an opportunity to have children. Assisted reproductive technologies operate by intervening and manipulating gametic and intrauterine natural selection. This paper discusses the possible influence of assisted reproductive technologies on child development. This paper outlines some of the reported changes in children resulting from assisted reproductive technologies. Although, few people are either aware or care about possible long term consequences of relaxed natural selection contributed by medical intervention (i.e. assisted reproductive technologies) we have little understanding to what extent such medical interference may affect long term fitness in humans.  © 2021 Arthur Saniotis et al.},

The “Energy Metabolism Achievement Test” (EMAT) and a structured interview form were used as data collection tools. The content analysis of the EMAT post-test indicated that PBL increased students’ responses in the sound and partial understanding categories and the Wilcoxon signed rank test result revealed that there was a significant difference between EMAT pre- and post-test scores in favor of post-test scores (z = − 12.567, p <.05). In addition, content analysis of the structured interview indicated that the majority of students expressed positive opinions about the PBL approach, including that it was memorable, interesting, and related to daily life. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

In Decline and Prosper!, demographic expert Vegard Skirbekk offers readers an accessible, comprehensive and evidence-based overview of human reproduction. Readers learn about the evolution of childbearing across different populations and how fertility is related to (changes in) our reproductive capacity, contraception, education, religion, partnering, policies, economics, assisted reproduction, and catastrophes. Readers will explore the future of family size and its impact on human welfare, women’s empowerment and the environment. Skirbekk argues that low fertility is on the whole a good thing, while recognizing the challenges of population aging and “coincidental” childlessness. A balanced, integrative examination of one of the most important issues of our time, Decline and Prosper! drives home the fact that we must ultimately adapt to a world with fewer children. The book will be invaluable to anyone who is interested in the far-reaching effects of global fertility, including researchers and students of demography, social statistics, medical sociologists, family and childhood studies, human geographers, sociology of culture, social and public policy. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

Holme I enclosed a central upturned tree-stump, its function and intent unknown. Holme II is thought a mortuary structure. Both are proposed here best explained as independent ritual responses to reverse a period of severe climate deterioration recorded before 2049 BC when their timbers were felled. Holme I is thought erected on the summer-solstice, when the cuckoo traditionally stopped singing, departing to the ‘Otherworld’. It replicated the cuckoo’s supposed overwintering quarters: a tree-hole or the ‘bowers of the Otherworld’ represented by the tree-stump, remembered in folklore as ‘penning-the-cuckoo’ where a cuckoo is confined to keep singing and maintain summer. The cuckoo symbolised male-fertility being associated with several Indo-European goddesses of fertility that deified Venus - one previously identified in EBA Britain. Some mortal consorts of these goddesses appear to have been ritually sacrificed at Samhain. Holme II may be an enclosure for the body of one such ‘sacral king’. These hypotheses are considered, using abductive reasoning, as ‘inferences to the best explanations’ from the available evidence. They are supported with environmental data, astronomic and biological evidence, regional folklore, toponymy, and an ethnographic analogy with indigenous Late Iron Age practices that indirect evidence indicates were undertaken in EBA Britain. Cultural and religious continuity is supported by textual sources, the material record and ancient DNA (aDNA) studies. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {The link between personality and fertility is relatively underexplored. Moreover, there are only a few studies focusing on the prospective association between personality and childbearing. However, none of these studies considered the Five-Factor Model (FFM), which is the most widely accepted measurement of personality. The present study fills this gap by examining the prospective association between the FFM and the hazard ratio of the first and the second childbirth in Germany. Analyses are based on recent data (2005–2017) from the Socio-economic Panel Study. Cox proportional hazard models are applied. Findings demonstrate that personality traits are associated with fertility. Extraversion is positively linked with the first childbirth, but is negatively associated with the second childbirth. These findings are mainly driven by males. Agreeableness is positively linked with the first childbirth across the total sample. Again, this correlation is mainly based on the findings for men, among whom a positive association between agreeableness and the second childbirth is also found. Among women, personality does not seem to be linked with the first childbirth. However, the risk of having a second child is found to be negatively associated with conscientiousness. My study adds to the current understanding of the personality–fertility association by exploring the impact of personality trait scores from the FFM on subsequent fertility behavior. However, further research is needed on the association between personality and childbearing; on the mechanisms through which personality affects fertility; and on how these links differ across cultures, among higher parities, and for births after re-partnering. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Based on ethnographic research between 2009 and 2013 in three fertility clinics in Istanbul and on a digital self-help platform I pay close attention to men’s emerging practices in the context of Turkey, where the neoliberal-authoritarian JDP (Justice and Development Party) has reinforced patriarchal and traditional gender identities and roles over the last two decades. I draw upon anthropological perspectives on new and emergent masculinities, and also examine how these are constructed, performed and renegotiated both online and offline. This I do by focusing on men’s narratives of what I call biosocial exclusion and counterstrategies, when men designated their role as ‘outsiders’ and/or ‘sperm providers’ during treatment. I use this concept to discuss men’s understandings of themselves as reproductive actors and as parts of biosocial relations–the couple, family and society. I argue that there are transformations in practices of male biosocial subjects. I aim to capture the effects of the new biosocial relations of self-help, advocacy and activism of concerned people–both online and offline. © 2020 The Nordic Association for Research on Men and Masculinities.},

This article analyzes the strength of the intergenerational transmission of family size over the last century, including a focus on this reproduction in large and small families. Using the large-scale French Family Survey (2011), we show a weak but significant correlation of approximately 0.12–0.15, which is comparable with levels in other Western countries. It is stronger for women than men, with a gender convergence across cohorts. A decrease in intergenerational transmission is observed across birth cohorts regardless of whether socioeconomic factors are controlled, supporting the idea that the family of origin has lost implicit and explicit influence on fertility choices. As parents were adopting the two-child family norm, the number of siblings lost its importance for having two children, but it continues to explain lower parity and, above all, three-child families. This suggests that the third child has increasingly become an “extra child” (beyond the norm) favored by people from large families. © 2019, The Author(s).},

In environmental health sciences such as toxicology, this has resulted in emphasizing the influence of toxic chemicals, substances, and situations across generations. Toxic relationalities are now being explored through research on gene–environment interaction, including toxicogenomics and epigenetic research through animal experiments and birth cohort studies. Based on fieldwork conducted among reproductive and developmental toxicologists working in Nanjing, China, this article shows how toxicological research both expresses and produces renewed anxieties about “passing down pollution.” These toxicological accounts of intergenerational harm problematically work through overly simplistic renderings of reproduction and biological relatedness. But they also have the potential to catalyze creative understandings of toxic relationalities and responsibilities at a moment when making kin is increasingly seen as key to securing livable futures.

Examining a series of men’s infertility blogs, I argue that men put forth their wounds and scars in ways that both challenge and recuperate hegemonic masculinity. Though it is important for men to share common experiences, the rhetorical uptake of male (in)fertility through the language of crisis and victimization serves to reaffirm cis, white, hetero masculinity’s hegemony. Such discourses embrace men’s wounds to fortify a position of solidarity through the adversity of (in)fertility. © 2020 The Organization for Research on Women and Communication.},

	abstract = {Below-replacement fertility has persisted across European countries for a few decades, though, with variation. Delays in age at first union and first birth have been key factors in the declining fertility levels within these societies. While the vast majority of births occurs within a stable partnership, the link between partnership formation and childbearing is rarely taken into account. In this paper, we examine the role of partnership formation in explaining the gap between Sweden and Spain regarding transitions to first birth. We utilize data from the 2018 Spanish Fertility Survey and the 2012/2013 Swedish Generations and Gender Survey to explore transition probabilities to first birth and implement Kitagawa decomposition and standardization techniques. Results show that having a partner is a strong predictor of becoming a first-time parent in the next 3 years, mainly within the ages 25 to 35. On average, Swedish first-birth transition probabilities for women are only 12% higher than probabilities of Spanish counterparts within this age range, suggesting that the proportion of partnerships formed plays a crucial role in explaining the fertility gap. Decomposition results confirm that before age 30, 74% of the difference in first-order births among women are due to the difference in partnership composition. We further find that earlier union formation in Spain could potentially reduce childlessness levels. Overall, our study highlights the importance of examining the role of partnership dynamics in fertility studies. © 2022, The Author(s).},

This chapter examines to what extent the effect of parental SES on partner status at first birth is mediated through own SES. Data from the Generations and Gender Survey, British Understanding Society Survey, Dutch Survey on Family Formation, American National Survey on Family Growth, and Canadian General Social Survey are used to examine 16 national contexts. In the majority of countries, the effect of parental SES on the likelihood of having a first birth in cohabitation and in marriage is partly explained by the intergenerational transmission of SES. A direct effect of parental SES is found in Canada, USA, Norway, Bulgaria, Estonia, Georgia, and Romania. The effect of parental SES on the likelihood of having a first birth while being single and in marriage is partly explained by the intergenerational transmission of SES. In the USA, Austria, and Norway, a direct effect of parental SES was also found. The results suggest that in addition to the intergenerational transmission of SES, differences in family aid may influence the transition to adulthood. It is also possible that parental SES influences the motivation and ability to prevent pregnancies. © The Author(s) 2021. All rights reserved.},

This high level of childlessness is somewhat surprising in the context of a significant gender imbalance among the highly educated (and thus the relative scarcity of highly educated men). In this study, I examine differences in childlessness among the highly educated by studying how educational prestige, social class, and income are associated with the likelihood of becoming a father. Higher income and social class background are positively associated with fatherhood, and this association has not changed over time. Educational prestige (higher degrees, or degrees from traditional universities) is not positively associated with fatherhood, while 2-year degrees have become more positively associated with fatherhood over time. The findings of this study suggest that socioeconomic resources are important for men's family formation in Sweden compared to educational resources, contrary to expectations from educational homophily and partner market perspectives. © 2019, The Author(s).},

Administrative register data are used to investigate how birth order affects completed fertility, how the number of siblings and birth order jointly affect completed fertility, and in both cases if there are gender differences in these relationships. Our data consist of all fully biologically related siblings in Sweden whose mothers were born between 1915 and 1935 (the younger generation is born primarily in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s; N = 1,472,813). To study the direct effect of birth order on fertility, sibling comparison models are applied, while to analyse the joint effect of number of siblings and birth order, the sample was stratified by birth order. Results show that higher birth order has a negative effect on completed fertility for women; hence, earlier-born women show overall higher fertility than later-born women. Parity transitions indicate that later-born women are less likely to have two or more children, while no overall gradient for men can be found. The number of siblings is more positively associated with completed fertility for firstborn than for later-born individuals. We conclude that the position in the family of origin can be seen as an additional factor that influences fertility, although effect sizes are rather small. © 2019, The Author(s).},

In 1950, the contribution of births at age 40 and over to female fertility rates ranged from 2.5 to 9 percent, but then fell sharply until the 1980s. From the 1990s, however, the prevalence of late first births increased rapidly, especially so in countries where it was initially lowest. This has produced a late fertility rebound in the last two decades, occurring much faster for women than for men.

Using data from the Demographic and Health Survey and gold mine geolocation data in Nigeria, the difference-in-differences estimation reveals that artisanal and small-scale gold mining in Nigeria has an adverse health effect on Muslim women's fertility. In particular, living near gold mines increases Muslim women's (i.e., the treated group) probability of infecundity or premature menopause by about 12 percentage points compared to Christian women (i.e., the untreated group), and the effects are stronger in northern Nigeria than in southern Nigeria. By eliminating other possible channels, the results show that the main mechanism appears to be Muslim women being more likely to work in gold mines in their family compounds. The results are robust to the alternative distance cutoffs, other measures of health outcomes, and triple-difference approach.

We find that one in five children in the 1979 cohort had at least one half-sibling by their 18th birthday, and the prevalence grew to more than one in four children by the 1997 cohort. A strong educational gradient in exposure to half-siblings persists across both cohorts, but large racial/ethnic disparities have narrowed over time. Using demographic decomposition techniques, we find that change in the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic composition of the U.S. population cannot explain the growth in exposure to half-siblings.

While focusing on trade shocks related to Chinese imported goods, the paper explores individual fertility via the labor market outcomes of manufacturing workers, roughly a fifth of German employment. I investigate the gender-specific effects of Chinese import competition on individual fertility and explain the channels mediating each of them. I find that globalization affects overall fertility negatively, but the effect is positive for women and negative for men. Results indicate a reduction in the employment opportunity of individuals, an increase in marginal employment and higher economic insecurity. There is a substitution effect in the labor supply of women, here prevalently concentrated in low-technology sectors: as female earnings fall and their opportunity cost of work is lower, the prospect of having children possibly becomes a more rewarding alternative. Given concerns over low fertility in Germany, findings are particularly important for understanding the German social and economic structure that enabled the country's post-reunification transformation but also allowed heavy labor market segmentation and atypical work. © 2021 The Authors.

This work examines the variations in Greek birth rates, and confirms that fertility rates in Greece have declined since 2010. Partly as a response to economic uncertainty, childbearing decisions have been revised downward, although not uniformly across population groups. According to our analysis, almost 40,000 fewer babies were born in Greece between 2010 and 2015 than would have been born if pre-recession fertility rates had remained unchanged. Those missing births are mainly attributed to women under age 30, as well as to non-employed women of all ages. In terms of birth order, most of the missing births are second- or higher-order births. Even if a catch-up process occurs in the years to come, the foregone births are already visible as a cavity on the population pyramid. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Subnational differences in male fertility within sub-Saharan African countries have not been explored, nor the differences in male fertility according to migration status been sufficiently probed. We study divergences in rural and urban male fertility and investigate the relationship between male fertility and migration across 30 sub-Saharan African countries. We employ 67 Demographic and Health Surveys to estimate completed cohort fertility among men aged 50–64 according to migration status. Overall, we find that urban male fertility has declined faster than rural male fertility, widening the gap between the sectors. Rural-urban migrant men have lower fertility than their rural non-migrant counterparts. Men migrating within the rural sector have similarly high fertility as rural non-migrants, while urban–urban migrant men have even lower fertility than non-migrant urban men. Using country-fixed effects models, we find that among men with at least secondary education, differences in completed cohort fertility by migration status are widest. When we consider the timing of migration in relation to the timing of the birth of the last child, we observe that migrant men are a select group, having around two children less than non-migrant rural men. There is also evidence of adaptation to destination, though to a lesser extent. Furthermore, migration within the rural sector does not seem to be disruptive to fathering. These results indicate that rural-to-urban migration has the potential to delay rural fertility decline, and that urban male fertility is likely to decline further, especially as the proportion of urban-to-urban migration increases. © 2023, The Author(s).},

There is a large generational difference; younger social media users share their sexualities at high rates, while for older cohorts marital status substitutes for sexual identity. Consistent with gendered expectations, women more often express a bisexual interest in men and women; men are more explicit about their heterosexuality. The authors interpret these variations in sexuality disclosure on social media to reflect the salience of sexual identity, intersected at times with availability.

Scholars generally use indirect methods rather than direct items to measure MPF due to data limitations. The redesigned 2014 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and the 2011–2015 Cycle of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) provide a unique opportunity to evaluate different measurement approaches. We document variation in prevalence estimates of MPF among women aged 15–44 across approaches and datasets. Overall, our findings suggest that 20–25% of mothers experience MPF. Direct measures of MPF produce lower prevalence estimates compared to semi-direct and indirect approaches, pointing to the possibility of social desirability bias. Moreover, direct measures seem to perform particularly poorly for less advantaged women. Further, variation in identifying MPF has implications for its association with other behaviors and outcomes. We conclude with a discussion of these findings and make recommendations for future data collection and research endeavors. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

After parents’ separation, however, mothers are still commonly the primary caregiver. A major change though has been the introduction of shared residency models. While in Sweden shared residency is widely adopted, in Germany, however, it is only rarely practiced. Drawing on these differences, the qualitative study uses data from 12 interviews to explore and compare experiences of fatherhood after separation in Sweden and Germany. The articles applies the concepts of caring and protective masculinities to discuss the relation between masculinity and fatherhood in men’s identities as fathers. Applying both concepts aims to theorize how both notions of care and protection are entangled in practices of male care. The study discovered that, even though most fathers in the sample have shared residency models, there is great variation in how fatherhood is experienced. The relationship with the mother, legal regulations and socio-cultural norms were identified as decisive determinants for post-separation fathering. Especially sharing care and responsibilities equally after separation contributed to sharpening men’s understanding of care work. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Even though a main goal of science is to reduce the uncertainty in scientific results by applying ever-improving research methods, epistemic uncertainty is an integral part of science. As such, while uncertainty might be communicated in news articles about climate science, climate skeptics have also exploited this uncertainty to cast doubt on science itself. We performed two studies to assess whether scientific uncertainty affects laypeople’s assessments of issue uncertainty, the credibility of the information, their trust in scientists and climate science, and impacts their decision-making. In addition, we addressed how these effects are influenced by further information on relevant scientific processes, because knowing that uncertainty goes along with scientific research could ease laypeople’s interpretations of uncertainty around evidence and may even protect against negative impacts of such uncertainty on trust. Unexpectedly, in study 1, after participants read both a text about research methods and a news article that included scientific uncertainty, they had lower trust in the scientists’ assertions than when they read the uncertain news article alone (but this did not impact trust in climate science or decision-making). In study 2, we tested whether these results occurred due to participants overestimating the scientific uncertainty at hand. Hence, we varied the framing of uncertainty in the text on scientific processes. We found that exaggerating the scientific uncertainty produced by scientific processes (vs. framing the uncertainty as something to be expected) did not negatively affect participants’ trust ratings. However, the degree to which participants preferred effortful reasoning on problems (intellective epistemic style) correlated with ratings of trust in scientists and climate science and with their decision-making. In sum, there was only little evidence that the introduction of uncertainty in news articles would affect participants’ ratings of trust and their decision-making, but their preferred style of reasoning did. © 2020 by the authors.},

Anthropologists’ analyses of this aspect of social life need to attend to these distinctions by applying concepts that are flexible but offer meaningful insights. This article investigates the complexities of modern parent–child relations, making two propositions that expand the concept of parenthood. I begin by arguing that the term parenthood should be more widely utilized by anthropologists when investigating kinship, due to its specificity and ability to address and contest issues of care and inequality. The notion of parenthood can reflect a diverse array of practices far beyond those of childbearing heterosexual couples—fostering, adoption, surrogacy, queer parenthoods, and parenthood via assisted reproductive technologies (ART)—while acknowledging the continued salience of normative parenting relations. I propose that feminist anthropologists could use the term parenthood to challenge the gendered assumptions surrounding motherhood and fatherhood (which remain highly influential regardless of parents’ relationship forms and sexualities) and to recognize and facilitate less rigid, less binary parenting performances. Drawing on anthropological, sociological, and feminist works on kinship, reproduction, and gender, I thus advocate for the conceptual utility of the term parenthood and point to future directions for such research. © 2022 The Authors.

They affect different sites, in males, sperm morphology, its motility and eventually its function can be affected at different levels of their development, maturation, and mobility. In females, cervical areas, tubal obstruction, and peritoneal damage are the common sites that are affected by infections, thus, interfering with human fertility. Other than direct infections, co-infections are also nowadays suspected to be responsible for impairment of sperm quality, motility, and mobility.

	abstract = {In recent studies on the association between education and fertility, increased attention has been paid to the fi eld of study. Women who studied in traditionally more “feminine” fi elds, like care, teaching, and health, were found to have their children earlier and to have more children than other women. A point of debate in this literature is on the causal direction of this relationship. Does the fi eld of study change the attitudes towards family formation, or do young adults with stronger family-life attitudes self-select into educational fi elds that emphasize care, teaching, and health? Or do both fi eld of study preferences and family-life attitudes arise before actual choices in these domains are made? We contribute to this debate by examining the relationship between fertility expectations and expected fi elds of study and occupation among 14-17 year-old adolescents. We use data collected in 2005 from 1500 Dutch adolescents and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to examine the associations between expected fi eld of study and occupation and fertility expectations. Our results show that expectations concerning fertility and fi eld of study are already interrelated during secondary education. Both female and male adolescents who expect to pursue studies in fi elds that focus on care and social interaction (like health care, teaching etc.) are less likely to expect to remain childless. This holds equally for girls and boys. In addition, girls who more strongly aspire to an occupation in which communication skills are important also expect to have more children. We did not fi nd any relationship between expectations of pursuing a communicative fi eld of study and occupation and expectations of earlier parenthood. In addition, among boys, we fi nd that the greater their expectation of opting for an economics, a technical, or a communicative fi eld of study, the less likely they were to expect to remain childless. Boys who expected to study in the economic fi eld also expect to have their fi rst child earlier, but boys expecting to pursue a technical course of studies expect to enter parenthood later. We also found that those who expect to pursue cultural studies are more likely to have a preference for no children, or if they do want children, to have them later in life. Overall, our fi ndings suggest that the processes of elective affi nity between the communicative fi elds of study and work on the one hand and fertility on the other hand are more or less comparable for boys and girls. With respect to the other domains, we fi nd, apart from the gender differences in the relation between fi elds of study and childlessness, hardly or no gender differences in the expected timing of parenthood and the number of children. The genders do differ in their level of preference for communicative and economics-related fi elds of study and occupation, but if they do have the same preference, the association with fertility expectations is more or less similar. © 2019, Bundesinstitut fur Bevolkerungsforschung.

	abstract = {In Norway, as in many other rich countries, childlessness is more common among men than women and has also increased more among men. Over the last 15 years, the gap in childlessness between 45-year-old women and men has widened from 5.8 to 10.2 percentage points, according to national register data. In the Norwegian-born subgroup, the gap has increased by 2.4 percentage points, from 5.8 to 8.2. The goal of the study was to identify the demographic drivers of this development, using a quite simple, but original, decomposition approach. The components reflect changes in relative cohort sizes, whether the child has one native and one immigrant parent, whether the father was older than 45, and whether one of the parents already had a child, no longer lived in Norway at age 45, or was unidentified. It was found that the modestly increasing sex gap in childlessness among the Norwegian-born is largely linked to changes in cohort sizes, i.e. fertility trends. Changes in re-partnership have actually contributed weakly in the opposite direction: It has become more common especially among men to have the first child with a partner who already had a child, and thus not contribute to bringing also that person out of childlessness. The importance of the various components is different for immigrants, among whom the sex gap in childlessness has increased particularly much. This development may also reflect that especially male immigrants perhaps have children in the home country who are not included in the Norwegian register. © 2021, The Author(s).},

This field applies computational methods to novel sources of digital data such as social media, administrative records, and historical archives to develop theories of human behavior. We review the evolution of this field within sociology via bibliometric analysis and in-depth analysis of the following subfields where this new work is appearing most rapidly: (a) social network analysis and group formation; (b) collective behavior and political sociology; (c) the sociology of knowledge; (d) cultural sociology, social psychology, and emotions; (e) the production of culture; (f) economic sociology and organizations; and (g) demography and population studies. Our review reveals that sociologists are not only at the center of cutting-edge research that addresses longstanding questions about human behavior but also developing new lines of inquiry about digital spaces as well. We conclude by discussing challenging new obstacles in the field, calling for increased attention to sociological theory, and identifying new areas where computational social science might be further integrated into mainstream sociology. © 2020 Annual Reviews Inc..

	abstract = {The paper aims to understand the treatment seeking behavior and the experiences of men with male factor infertility. A cross-sectional study was conducted at consented hospitals/infertility centers in Mumbai, India in purview of the fact that men are not considered as important as a part of infertility treatment as women. An infertile man is defined here as one who is diagnosed with primary or secondary infertility, undergoing infertility treatment, irrespective of the fertility status of his wife. Primary data of 150 men undergoing infertility treatment from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds was collected through semi-structured interviews. The initial effect of the infertility status led the men to feel depressed, guilty, shocked, and isolated. A large proportion of the respondents never discussed the problem with anyone except their wives. More than one third of the respondents consulted with Ayurvedic, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy (AYUSH) practitioners. Changes of doctors or clinics were more attributed to unsuccessful treatment cycles and success rate of other clinics than the referral by doctors. Destiny, bad luck, lifestyle, medical reasons, and late marriage are found as perceived causes of male infertility. Age above 40, younger age at marriage, marriage duration for 6 and more years, secondary infertility, self-employment, and higher income have significant association with longer time gap between marriage and initiation of infertility treatment. Based on study findings, we propose Belief and Practice theory where we elaborate the progression in treatment for male infertility. Men should be given due consideration in infertility treatment. They must be taken into consideration at an early stage of fertility evaluation due to the fact that minor problems of male infertility can be cured with modest medication. Proper Information Education and Communication (IEC) is essential for creating awareness in society on male infertility. Better counseling services during treatment and standardization of cost can help infertile men to manage treatment-related stress. Since infertility treatment is a time-consuming and exhaustive process, considering the timing for patient's income generating work, evening out patient department, and comprehensive knowledge dissemination at health centers can be improve male factor infertility treatment. © Copyright © 2020 Baranwal and Chattopadhyay.},

Drawing from the Theory of Conjunctural Action and the Narratives of the Future framework, this work considers how objective and subjective socioeconomic conditions, psychosocial characteristics, and perceptions of well-being are linked to mothers’ and childless women's (a) prospective fertility intentions during the Great Recession, (b) realization of those intentions in the post-Recession period, and (c) fertility intentions toward the end of the reproductive years, using Waves IV and V of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. The results confirm the role of standard socioeconomic measures and also highlight the importance of subjective measures. In general, more advantaged women were more likely to intend to have (more) children at both waves and to have children between waves. Furthermore, women who already had children by the Great Recession were more likely than their childless peers to have a(nother) child in the post-Recession period. As this cohort approaches the end of its childbearing years, having unfulfilled fertility plans from earlier in the reproductive life course is a strong predictor of continuing to intend at least one birth. © 2022 The Population Council, Inc.},

One consistent finding of the literature is that women and men are affected differently by divorce and separation. Women, and particularly mothers, are likely to suffer from a loss of income. Fathers frequently suffer from having reduced contact with their children, who usually continue to live with their mother after a union dissolution. This chapter uses 10 years of data from the German Family Panel (pairfam) to examine more closely the gender differences in life satisfaction after separation. In line with previous research, we show that following a separation, satisfaction with family life declines more among fathers than among mothers, and that mothers tend to experience a greater decline in their satisfaction with their financial situation than fathers. We also examine the role of shared parenting (Wechselmodell) in parents’ life satisfaction. Our findings indicate that shared parenting is positively associated with well-being, but also that the association is not stable to the inclusion of socio-economic characteristics that explain the selection into shared parenting. The results are discussed in the context of the current German policy debate on shared parenting. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In the post-Recession era, U.S. fertility rates have continued to fall. It is unclear if these declines are driven by shifts in fertility goals or growing difficulty in achieving goals. In this paper, we construct synthetic cohorts of men and women to examine both cross-cohort and within-cohort changes in fertility goals using multiple cycles of the National Survey of Family Growth. Although more recent cohorts exhibit lower achieved fertility at younger ages than earlier cohorts at the same age, intended parity remains around two children, and intentions to remain childless rarely exceed 15 percent. There is weak evidence of a growing fertility gap in the early 30s, suggesting more recent cohorts will need considerable childbearing in the 30s and early 40s to “catch up” to earlier goals, yet low-parity women in their early 40s are decreasingly likely to have unfulfilled fertility desires or intentions to have children. Low-parity men in their early 40s, though, are increasingly likely to intend children. Declines in U.S. fertility thus seem to be largely driven not by changes in early-life fertility goals so much as either a decreasing likelihood of achieving earlier goals or, perhaps, shifts in the preferred timing of fertility that depress period measures. © 2022 The Population Council, Inc.},

	abstract = {PERSPECTIVES IN MALE PSYCHOLOGY Discover a balanced perspective on men’s psychology in this accessible new resource Male psychology is a new field within the discipline of psychology, which focuses on men and boys. Male psychology moves us towards a more scientific and balanced understanding of the ­psychology of men and of boys, drawing on a range of perspectives, and away from an overreliance on social constructionism and preoccupations with notions such as patriarchy and privilege, too often seen in the narrative about men. In Perspectives in Male Psychology: An Introduction, two of the most prominent authors in this new field, Louise Liddon and John Barry, introduce and deliver an insightful exploration of some of today’s most hotly contested issues regarding men and masculinity. This book puts forward a balanced perspective that has been missing from academic and media narratives around topics such as child development, education, sport and exercise, the workplace, crime, the military, health and wellbeing, mental health, therapy, masculinity, and sex differences, and considers the role that evolution, biology, and culture play in shaping male behavior. This book will also help readers to better understand some key issues such as: Why there are controversies around sex differences research How bias in research has led to a distorted view of the psychology of men and boys The ways in which the mental health and other needs of men and boys are routinely overlooked In turn this helps us ask some important questions such as: If there are more similarities than differences between men and women, does that mean the differences are unimportant? How can we un-distort our understanding of men and masculinity? What are the best ways of identifying and meeting the psychological needs of men and boys? Readers, whether students or lecturers, will also benefit from the inclusion of our companion Wiley website containing additional resources to support the development of knowledge and understanding of male psychology. Perfect for undergraduate and graduate students in psychology, medicine, and sociology, as well as established professionals in these and related fields, Perspectives in Male Psychology: An Introduction will also earn a place in the libraries of anyone interested in the psychology of sex and gender differences in various aspects of mental health and human behaviour. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Not only is reproduction increasingly becoming technologized, but men’s reproductive systems entangle with technological developments in complex ways. This paper takes its empirical point of departure from the marketing of three male fertility surveillance and optimization technologies to examine how men become discursively and visually implicated as repro-consumers. Whereas the Danish company ExSeed Health provides men with a take-home sperm test and lifestyle app, U.S.-located Snowballs Underwear and Polish CoolMen design cooling technologies to ‘naturally’ improve men’s fertility and testosterone levels. Theoretically, the paper draws upon social scientific theorizing of biomedicalization and fertility consumption as a way to ensure ideals of reproductive virility as well as critical studies of men and masculinity that view the latter as a social, relational, and historical construction. Situating the Fertility Tech industry as an important under-theorized example of emergent repro-technologies, this paper analytically discusses how ‘proactive’ and ‘prevention-conscious’ reproductive masculinities appear in the material. The allure of surveillance and optimization technologies lies, the article concludes, in the reiteration of a white, Western biomedical mandate to reproduce as well as in the continued optimization of reproduction. © 2020 The Nordic Association for Research on Men and Masculinities.},

These age differences become particularly relevant when couples transition to having a(nother) child, as such an event often results in a renegotiation of the gendered division of labor. Surprisingly, the literature on female empowerment and fertility postponement has so far paid little attention to parental age differences. This paper makes use of a new data set to present a demographic analysis of trends in parental age differences at childbirth in 15 high-income countries, covering a period in which all of these countries experienced changes in gender relations and fertility postponement. The general trends in rising mean ages at childbirth have evolved quite similarly among men and women. However, we demonstrate that these similarities hide previously unexplored and highly gendered disparities in parental age differences. Older mothers report much smaller mean parental age differences than younger mothers, and this age pattern among mothers has further polarized over time. By contrast, older fathers report larger parental age differences than younger fathers, while the disparities by age among fathers have not changed much over time. We discuss the relevance of our findings at both the individual and the societal level. © 2023 The Authors.

The main goal of this work was to explore, for the first time, the relationship between health and fertility intentions among migrants by gender, duration of stay and parity. Three health measures were considered: self-rated health, the presence of chronic illnesses and mental health. We compiled data from the Italian survey "Social Condition and Integration of Foreign Citizens" and employed generalized ordered logistic models to test the relationship between health and fertility intentions among migrants. Our findings show that poor health negatively affects migrants’ fertility intentions, net of a wide array of control variables (including employment and reason for migration). This is especially true among long-term migrant women, and, among the latter, the effect is strongest when chronic illnesses and mental health are considered. We encourage future research to consider health in the demographic debate about migrant fertility. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {In this chapter, we dissect the observed differences in men’s and women’s fertility as represented in the 2014 Survey of Income and Program Participation’s (SIPP) Wave 1 data. We consider the differences between men’s, women’s, and children’s reports of fathers and fatherhood. We argue that these data offer evidence of a “missing man” problem, rather than misreporting of the part of SIPP respondents. We then use the triangulation of these data points to model the size, and some of the characteristics, of the missing men. This estimation technique should be applied to other data sources to further disentangle what or who may be missing from our current estimates of men’s fertility. Based on our derived estimates, we conclude by offering a re-estimation of key factors of men’s fertility in a sample that did not differentially omit not just fathers, but certain types of fathers. We offer this as evidence in support of more, and more in-depth, research into men’s fertility, and men’s survey non-response. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

We compare the change in the fertility rate and in health at birth in Flint before and after the water switch to the changes in other cities in Michigan. We find that Flint fertility rates decreased by 12 % and that overall health at birth decreased. This effect on health at birth is a function of two countervailing mechanisms: (1) negative selection of less healthy embryos and fetuses not surviving (raising the average health of survivors), and (2) those who survived being scarred (decreasing average health). We untangle this to find a net of selection scarring effect of 5.4 % decrease in birth weight. Because of long-term effects of in utero exposure, these effects are likely lower bounds on the overall effects of this exposure. © 2019, Population Association of America.},

These findings suggest that paternal exposures influence phenotypic variation in unexposed progeny–a proposal that runs counter to canonical ideas about inheritance developed during the 20th century. Nevertheless, support for paternal germline epigenetic inheritance (GEI) in nonhuman mammals continues to grow and the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are becoming clearer. To what extent do similar processes operate in humans, and if so, what are their implications for understanding human phenotypic variation, health, and evolution? Here, we review evidence for GEI in human and nonhuman mammals and evaluate these findings in relation to historical conceptions of heredity. Drawing on epidemiological data, reproductive biology, and molecular embryology, we outline developments and opportunities for the study of GEI in human populations, emphasizing the challenges that researchers in this area still face. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Using high-frequency panel data from the country designed to follow single women and men into marriage, we examine the extent to which premarital fertility is associated with the timing of marriage. Two notable findings emerge. First, premarital fertility typically leads to a more rapid transition into marriage, compared to not having had a premarital conception or birth, and this effect is as strong for men as it is for women. Second, among women with premarital fertility, those who are wealthier, and those who have two parents alive, have lower odds of not marrying. Among men with premarital fertility, however, no patterns predict their subsequent marital outcomes.

This article conversely examines childlessness among men in Czechia – a European post-socialist country in which becoming a parent was a strong social norm before 1989. This article asks how men’s explanations for being childless or childfree change over time and what this says about changing norms attached to parenthood in different historical and social contexts. It draws on an analysis of 24 problem-centred interviews conducted in two rounds about a decade apart on the same sample of child-less or free men. This approach is not usually applied in research on this subject. In the first interviews, the men’s narratives mainly reveal their different views on the impact the post-1989 social transformation had on their lives in relation to their perceived resources and life chances. The follow-up interviews show how the men’s views on their lives change with age, the different emphasis they place on free choice versus the effect of external factors over time, and the narrow line that they construct between ‘involuntary’ and ‘voluntary’ childlessness. The narratives of child-less or free men unveil that the norm of becoming a parent is growing weaker in Czech society, but age norms and the norms regarding pathways to parenthood are still strong. The article seeks to understand how Czech men construct their childlessness over time, thus contributing to the discussion of childlessness among men and filling the gap in knowledge on men’s childlessness in CEE. © The Author(s) 2021.},

The cur­rent study helps to close this gap by con­sid­er­ing moves by either adult daugh­ters or moth­ers that lead them to live nearby again. We use Bel­gian reg­is­ter data on a cohort of 16,742 first­born girls aged 15 at the begin­ning of 1991 and their moth­ers who lived apart at least once dur­ing the observed period (1991–2015).

The results show that daugh­ters were more likely to move closer to their moth­ers dur­ing their first preg­nancy and that moth­ers were more likely to move closer to their daugh­ters when the daugh­ters’ children were older than 2.5 years.

This paper sets out to understand what male hormonal contraception (MHC) means for the performance of masculinity. Specifically, I seek to understand how contraceptive technology might contribute to the emergence and transformation of different masculine identities, and whether these identities will function to enhance or denounce the technology’s cultural feasibility and widespread assimilation. Amid the heavily quantitative nature of literature on this topic, I conduct semi-structured interviews to form a more intimate understanding of this relationship. Through thematic analysis, this project reveals a typology of three analytic figures which surface in response to the future existence of MHC: the ‘responsible, caring man’, the ‘lazy man’, and the ‘independent, heterosexual man’. The ways in which these identities conflict, complement, and interact with each other indicate how masculinities are being negotiated upon a shifting contraceptive landscape. The conclusions derived from my analyses are twofold: Firstly, that the cultural feasibility of MHC in western contexts will simultaneously demand and induce a destabilisation of conventionalised gender performances. Secondly, that the masculinities which emerge from this new frontier of contraception are complex, multiple and fluid. The investigation ends by looking at the wider implications of my findings for policy and practice. © 2023 Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Institute of Sociology. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This work contributes to the current understanding of the heterogeneous impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on fertility. Using more than 36.4 million birth and death records for Brazil and Colombia (2015–2021), we document state-level correlations between the intensity of the pandemic, measured by the current and 9-month lagged excess mortality, and the observed number of births relative to a Covid-19-free hypothetical scenario. We disaggregate these correlations according to maternal age and years of schooling to test the hypothesis that the influence of the Covid-19 pandemic on births interacted with pre-existing forms of social inequality. Results from multivariate linear models suggest that the association between the intensity of the pandemic and the relative number of births was negative for women with at least 8 years of schooling, while it was positive or null for women with fewer years of education. This result means that in subnational areas severely hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, women with few years of schooling did not delay fertility as most women potentially did. These results suggest that disadvantaged groups in Latin America and potentially in other contexts may suffer more acutely the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has been largely neglected by studies that assume homogeneous impacts of Covid-19 on population dynamics. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Children are born and grow up in households, where they receive essential care, including time, socio-psychological support, and economic resources. Children’s immediate environment, captured by household structure, changes over time. OBJECTIVE We evaluate the role of dynamic household structure in the risk of child death in southern and eastern Africa. METHODS We use longitudinal data from 15 Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems between 1990 and 2016, covering almost 282,000 under-5 year olds. We analyse under-5 mortality using semi-parametric Cox models accounting for time-varying household structure (household size and household typology) and controlling for maternal characteristics. RESULTS We find that children in smaller households have a higher risk of death than those in large households. In particular, children in households where they are the sole child with two adults of opposite sexes have the lowest chances of survival, reflecting a first-child effect. By contrast, nuclear-type households with more than one child are the most protective, while children in extended households are more vulnerable. CONTRIBUTION Our findings suggest that the (in)stability of households is important in evaluating child survival, and that it is imperative to consider households as changing entities. © 2023 Ashira Menashe-Oren et al.},

Methods: An explanatory sequential mixed methods design was conducted between March 2017 and April 2018. First, the research team collected and analysed the quantitative data from a sample of 400 young adults, between 18 and 28 years old, in Zanjan, Iran, followed by the collection and analysis of the qualitative data from 11 participants who had low self-control trait and history of condomless sex, and concluded by interpreting and synthesizing all results. Results: The association between condomless sex and low self-control was statistically significant. In the qualitative phase, the emerged themes for condomless sex were (1) low perceived risk, (2) trusting the partner, (3) humiliation posed by friends for condom use, and (4) surrendering to the partner’s insistence on not using condom. Conclusions: Young adults with low self-control tend to easily engage in unsafe sex. Consulting those with low self-control and improving the needed skills could be useful in preventing unsafe sexual activities and other risky behaviours among young adults. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND In recognition of the empowering potential of digital technologies, gender equality in internet access and digital skills is an important target in the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Gender-disaggregated data on internet use are limited, particularly in less developed countries. OBJECTIVE We leverage anonymous, aggregate data on the online populations of Google and Facebook users available from their advertising platforms to fill existing data gaps and measure global digital gender inequality. METHODS We generate indicators of country-level gender gaps on Google and Facebook. Using these online indicators independently and in combination with offline development indicators, we build regression models to predict gender gaps in internet use and digital skills computed using available survey data from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). RESULTS We find that women are significantly underrepresented in the online populations of Google and Facebook in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. These platform-specific gender gaps are a strong predictor that women lack internet access and basic digital skills in these populations. Comparing platforms, we find Facebook gender gap indicators perform better than Google indicators at predicting ITU internet use and low-level digital-skill gender gaps. Models using these online indicators outperform those using only offline development indicators. The best performing models, however, are those that combine Facebook and Google online indicators with a country's development indicators such as the Human Development Index. CONTRIBUTION Our work highlights how appropriate regression models built on novel, digital data from online populations can be used to complement traditional data sources to monitor global development indicators linked to digital gender inequality. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the fertility behavior of Turkish men in Europe from a context of origin perspective. Men of the first and subsequent migrant generations are compared with “stayers” from the same regions of origin in Turkey. We pay special attention to the men’s reasons for migration by distinguishing between work and nonwork motivations for migration. We use data from the 2000 Families Study, which was conducted in 2010 and 2011 in Turkey and in western European countries; the sample consists of about 3,500 men. We analyze the transitions to fatherhood as well as to second and third births using event-history analyses; and we investigate the cumulated number of children using Poisson regression analysis. As the men were aged 18–92 at the data collection, we carry out separate models for birth cohort groups. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis of the interrelatedness of events. First-generation migrant men show elevated first birth transitions, which are closely linked to marriage and migration. However, in contrast to the pattern that is often found for women, this effect is observed for labor as well as for nonwork migrants. The rates of transition to a second and a third birth differ less from those of stayers. Analyses of cumulated fertility at age 41 or older further suggest that the migrants’ overall numbers of children are smaller than those of the stayers in Turkey. Thus, our findings indicate that there are dissimilation processes and crossover trends among emigrant men characterized by higher rates of transition to family formation linked to migration but lower overall fertility. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The social networks of people play a prominent role in theories on fertility. Investigating how networks shape behaviour is hard, because of the difficulty in measuring (large) networks among representative samples. Therefore, comprehensive studies of the variation in the structure and composition of networks and their impact on fertility outcomes are lacking. OBJECTIVE I aim to, first, describe the Dutch Social Networks and Fertility Study, and, second, describe the R-package FertNet that processes data from this study and transforms it into an easy-to-use format for researchers. METHODS The data used are from the Longitudinal Internet Social Survey (LISS) panel, a representative panel of Dutch households. The focus is on the Social Networks and Fertility Study that includes a subsample of women between the ages of 18‒40. Specific survey software was designed to capture each respondent’s personal network comprising 25 individuals with whom they had a relationship. In total, 758 women reported on over 18,750 relationships. For each person with whom the respondent had a relationship, several questions were asked about fertility-related topics. Uniquely, the connections between these people were also assessed. The R-package FertNet corrects data issues and transforms unstructured network data into alter-attribute and alter-tie datasets that can be handled by a diversity of network analytical approaches. CONTRIBUTION The Social Networks and Fertility Study is a unique resource that allows for a comprehensive investigation of how networks shape fertility behaviour. It provides better estimates of network characteristics than earlier literature based on smaller networks. The R-package FertNet assists researchers in their analyses. © 2023 Gert Stulp.},

Results suggest that EITC exposure in childhood leads women to delay marriage and first births in early adulthood (ages 16–25), but has no effect on men. A $1,000 increase in EITC exposure in childhood leads to a 2%–3% decline in a woman’s likelihood of having a first birth and a comparable decline in her likelihood of marrying by her early 20s. We find similar reductions in fertility among Black and White women, though marriage declines are concentrated among White women. Results are focused on children growing up in the bottom half of the income distribution and those who spent the majority of childhood residing with a single parent—two groups that are the primary beneficiaries of the EITC. These findings have important implications for the well-being of individuals exposed to the EITC in childhood, as well as their future children. © 2021 The Authors.},

Using Swedish population and military conscription registers, we study how body mass index (BMI), physical fitness, and height are associated with total fertility and parity transitions by 2012 among 405,427 Swedish men born 1965–1972, meaning we observe fertility up to age 40 or older. Applying linear regression and sibling fixed effects, we find that these anthropometric measures are strong predictors of fertility, even after accounting for education and cumulative income. Men with a “normal” BMI and in the highest decile of physical fitness have the most children. Men who were obese at ages 17–20 had a relative probability of childlessness almost twice as high as men who had a “normal” BMI, and men in the bottom decile of physical fitness had a relatively probability of childlessness more than 50 percent higher than men in the top decile. In sibling comparison models the tallest men have the most children and men in the lowest two deciles of height have significantly lower fertility. Further analyses show that the strong associations persist even among men who married. © 2020 The Authors. Population and Development Review published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Poor Women, Powerful Men chronicles the achievements and subsequent failure of the Louisiana Family Health Foundation, the most extensive family planning program ever to operate in the United States. Martha C. Ward’s even-handed account reveals the mechanisms-of politics, poverty, and public health policies-at work in the perpetual controversies surrounding reproductive rights and the delivery of health care services to the poor. Ward’s book begins in the early 1960s when Louisiana was among the most underdeveloped states and ranked at the bottom of all scales measuring illiteracy, illegitimacy, and infant mortality. Despite the free statewide Charity Hospital system, many routine preventive medical and public health services were not available to poor women and their children, particularly if they were black. But in the mid-1960s, a visionary group of doctors and health care practitioners began to clear the hurdles erected by law, church, and the medical-political establishment. By 1970 they had set up the first statewide family planning program for poor people in the United States. The Louisiana experiment was a spectacular success. The Ford, Rockefeller, and Kellogg Foundations poured millions of dollars into the program. The Great Society and War on Poverty programs placed a high priority on the health of poor mothers and infants. With the help of the population lobby-including Planned Parenthood and the Agency for International Development-the Family Health Foundation moved into Latin America and other developing areas. But in 1974, the bubble burst. Accusations of fiscal mismanagement, fraudulent statistics, patronage, and political payoffs led to federal indictments and jail sentences for top officials. Poor women and powerful men, the black and white communities, and the liberal and conservative medical factions were pitted against each other. With the collapse of the program, methods for handling the epidemic of adolescent pregnancies and the high infant mortality rate reverted to the state bureaucracies. Poor Women, Powerful Men is the first book-length account of the Louisiana experiment. In a clear and dispassionate voice, Ward demonstrates that many of the questions raised by the experiment persist. Is family planning an answer to the cycle of poverty, teenage pregnancies, and infant mortality? How can the conflict between private and public delivery of medical care be resolved? Where do the reproductive rights of women fit into governmentally supported birth control programs? We seem no closer today to answering these questions than the Louisiana Family Health Foundation was more than a decade ago. © 1986 Taylor & Francis. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Most social phenomena are inherently complex and hard to measure, often due to under-reporting, stigma, social desirability bias, and rapidly changing external circumstances. This is for instance the case of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV), a highly-prevalent social phenomenon which has drastically risen in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper explores whether big data—an increasingly common tool to track, nowcast, and forecast social phenomena in close-to-real time—might help track and understand IPV dynamics. We leverage online data from Google Trends to explore whether online searches might help reach “hard-to-reach” populations such as victims of IPV using Italy as a case-study. We ask the following questions: Can digital traces help predict instances of IPV—both potential threat and actual violent cases—in Italy? Is their predictive power weaker or stronger in the aftermath of crises such as COVID-19? Our results suggest that online searches using selected keywords measuring different facets of IPV are a powerful tool to track potential threats of IPV before and during global-level crises such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, with stronger predictive power post outbreaks. Conversely, online searches help predict actual violence only in post-outbreak scenarios. Our findings, validated by a Facebook survey, also highlight the important role that socioeconomic status (SES) plays in shaping online search behavior, thus shedding new light on the role played by third-level digital divides in determining the predictive power of digital traces. More specifically, they suggest that forecasting might be more reliable among high-SES population strata. © 2022, The Author(s).},

This means that since the 2020s political analysis encompasses the entire sphere of the planet and cannot be conducted without a holistic approach. The first section remembers the 100-year planetary organic crisis from ecological overshoot in 1970 to population decline in 2070. The rest of the reminiscence covers three presents since the 2022 quantum inflation event, where three parallel universes were pinched off from the larger expanding multiverse. The first status quo present since 2022 was the return of reactionary power politics and the rebirth of Dieselpunk imaginary. The second capitalist present since 2022 was the continued neoliberal globalisation of politics and the acceleration of Cyberpunk imaginary. The third symbiotic present since 2022 was the birth of eco-social politics and the growth of Solarpunk imaginary. By the date of this recollection of how we arrived at planetary politics in 2122, only one of these three presented a future in any meaningful sense for human beings. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

	abstract = {In this article, we are concerned with the expanded public health interest in the “preconception period” as a window of opportunity for intervention to improve long-term population health outcomes. While definitions of the “preconception period” remain vague, new classifications and categories of life are becoming formalized as biomedicine begins to conduct research on, and suggest intervention in, this undefined and potentially unlimited time before conception. In particular, we focus on the burgeoning epidemiological interest in epigenetics and Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) research as simultaneously a theoretical spyglass into postgenomic biology and a catalyst toward a public health focus on preconception care. We historicize the notion that there are long-term implications of parental behaviors before conception, illustrating how, as Han and Das have noted, “newness comes to be embedded in older forms even as it transforms them” (Han and Das, 2015, p. 2). We then consider how DOHaD frameworks justify a number of fragmented claims about preconception by making novel evidentiary assertions. Engaging with the philosophy of Georges Canguilhem, we examine the relationship between reproductive risk and revised understandings of biological permeability, and discuss some of the epistemic and political implications of emerging claims in postgenomics. © Copyright © 2020 Pentecost and Meloni.},

We examine developments in nuptiality and the family, fertility and its intermediate variables, child and adult mortality, migration and urbanization, and population size and age structures. We conclude by considering the population prospects and challenges to be met by 2050 in education, health, and employment. While Africa will continue to have the highest population growth and the youngest population in the world throughout the 21st century, various transformations are under way, albeit at different paces across regions, countries, places of residence, and social groups, leading to an increasing diversification of sub-Saharan demographic regimes and to significant social and spatial inequalities. Most countries have just experienced their first decline in fertility, contraceptive use has increased, but the demand for children remains high. Age at first union is rising everywhere, polygamy is declining, but age disparities between partners and the proportion of adolescent marriages are still substantial. Mortality (especially child mortality), however, has seen a remarkable decline on the regional level, and life expectancy has considerably increased; AIDS is on the decline but far from having disappeared, maternal mortality remains high, and noncommunicable diseases are on the rise, resulting in an epidemiological double burden. Sub-Saharan Africa is urbanizing though at various paces and more slowly than was imagined 20 years ago. The number of large cities and megacities is also increasing. International migration has been rising sharply since 2000, though still mostly within the continent, with a greater diversity of destinations and a decline in traditional models of migration outside Africa. Finally, according to the UN’s medium-variant scenario, i.e. the most reasonable projection whereby the population will double by 2050 and more than triple by 2100, sub-Saharan Africa faces considerable challenges in education, health, employment, security, and sustainable development. © Institut national d'études démographiques.

	abstract = {Behaviors during the transition to adulthood have the potential to influence long-term childbearing trajectories. Though overlooked in prior work, criminal behaviors are one such set of possible influences on later fertility. Criminal activity during adolescence and young adulthood could be linked to fewer children (if deviance reduces partnerships due to lower desirability as a mate or if incarceration reduces exposure) or more children (if deviance is indicative of sexual risk-taking or, perhaps counterintuitively, makes one more more desirable as a partner). Further, the link likely depends on the timing and duration of such activity. Using the National Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), we consider both timing and persistence of offending in adolescence (Wave I) and young adulthood (Wave III) as a predictor of the number of births by early-mid adulthood (Wave V), accounting for union experiences, incarceration, and risky sexual activity, along with a number of sociodemographic characteristics. For both men and women, offending is linked to fewer children. Compared to those with no history of offending, men who began offending in young adulthood and women who offended in both adolescence and young adulthood have significantly fewer children (b = −0.175 and b = −0.136, respectively) even after accounting for potentially confounding factors. Offending in young adulthood appears to indicate unique processes that depress fertility. Future work should identify specific mechanisms, such as lower desire for children or more stigmatization in the relationship market, that reduce childbearing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Obtaining cross-country comparative perspectives on male fertility has long been difficult, as male fertility is usually less well registered than female fertility. Recent methodological advancements in imputing missing paternal ages at childbirth enable us to provide a new database on male fertility. This new resource covers more than 330 million live births and is based on a consistent and well-tested set of methods. These methods allow us to handle missing information on the paternal age, which is missing for roughly 10% of births. The data resource is made available in the Human Fertility Collection and allows for the first time a comparative perspective on male fertility in high-income countries using high-quality birth register data. We analyze trends in male–female fertility quantum and tempo differentials across 17 high-income countries, dating as back as far as the late 1960s for some countries, and with data available for the majority of countries from the 1980s onward. Using descriptive and counterfactual analysis methods, we find substantial variation both across countries and over time. Related to the quantum we demonstrate that disparities between male and female period fertility rates are driven to a large degree by the interplay of parental age and cohort size differences. For parental age differences at childbirth, we observe a development toward smaller disparities, except in Eastern Europe. This observation fits with expectations based on gender theories. However, variation across countries also seems to be driven by factors other than gender equality. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {One oft-suggested explanation for higher unintended fertility among racialized minorities is that they have less accurate reproductive knowledge and hold different attitudes about having children under various circumstances relative to non-Hispanic Whites. However, testing this explanation is challenging because it is unclear how to identify and measure relevant elements of attitudes and knowledge. In this paper, we make two key contributions to address this challenge. First, we test whether different indicators of reproductive attitudes and knowledge explain race-ethnic-nativity differences in unintended fertility, using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We compare models using individual items and models using latent factors derived in prior research. Although both individual items and factors measuring attitudes and knowledge vary by race-ethnicity-nativity, few indicators significantly predict unintended fertility in the expected direction, and race-ethnic-nativity differences remain statistically significant after controlling for these indicators. Second, we assess whether the previously-developed factor structure fits equally well across different race-ethnic-nativity groups, Using factor analytic techniques, we show that reproductive attitudinal and knowledge factors do not hold equally well across race-ethnicity-nativity, suggesting that attitudinal and knowledge measures may tap into different underlying concepts across sub-populations and thus have limited utility for explaining group differences. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Most of the demographic and social sciences literature examining the postponement of parenthood has paid primary attention to women. To address this gap, this article foregrounds the changing social landscape of masculinity as a significant context within which to situate these demographic changes. At the core of Nigerian men's perceptions, decisions, and behaviors with regard to delaying fatherhood is a fundamental contradiction, one that seems to be common in many settings—at least many African settings—of contemporary demographic transition. The contradiction is that while the postponement of parenthood is associated historically with positive social and economic indicators, when Nigerian men articulate their rationales for delaying fatherhood (and marriage) they commonly describe feelings of uncertainty connected to a sense of struggle and deprivation. This article connects men's anxieties about—and delays embarking on—marriage and parenthood to their experiences of economic uncertainty, and specifically to the perceived need for money as the foundation for successful reproduction. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc},

Education expansion played animportant role in this process by promoting changes in social norms and in assortativemating profiles.OBJECTIVEThe goal is to estimate cohort fertility rates (CFR) of women in union by educationalpairing (different combinations of men’s and women’s educational levels) and whetherchanges observed in assortative mating profiles were associated to the Brazilian cohortfertility transition.METHODSFirst, we estimate CFR by educational pairings for women cohorts born between 1925and 1969. Second, we decompose the difference in CFR between younger and oldercohorts into two components, the effects of changes in the composition of educationalpairings (structural changes) and the rate effects (other factors).RESULTSThe CFR of couples in Brazil declined from levels higher than 6 children per women forcohorts born in 1925–1929, to less than 3 children for women born in 1965–1969.Changes in the composition of educational pairing corresponded to approximately onethirdof these reductions in cohort fertility. CONCLUSIONSThese results suggest that changes in the composition of educational pairing related tothe rising education levels of men and women corresponded to an important share of thecohort fertility decline of women in unions.CONTRIBUTIONThe evaluation of the Brazilian fertility transition through the lens of cohort fertility andeducational pairings may provide new insights and methodological alternatives forassessing fertility transition in countries that rely on censuses as the main data source forfertility estimation. © 2022.

	abstract = {In high-income countries, women increasingly remain permanently childless. Little is known about the relationship between childlessness and socioeconomic development in non-Western societies and particularly sub-Saharan Africa. At lower levels of development, poverty-driven (i.e., involuntary) childlessness may decrease with increases in levels of development, while at higher levels of development opportunity-driven (i.e., voluntary and circumstantial) childlessness may rise with development. Thus, we expect a U-shaped relationship between childlessness and development overall. We examine this idea for sub-Saharan Africa. We further contribute by differentiating between female and male childlessness; and between involuntary, voluntary and circumstantial childlessness. Moreover, we construct new indicators of subnational historical development to assess both inter- and intra-country variation, and distinguish between three components (health, education and income) to investigate the drivers behind the hypothesized U-shaped relationship. Using 291 Demographic and Health Surveys between 1986 and 2018 from 38 countries and 384 regions, we find a U-shaped relationship between female childlessness and development, and a linear relationship for men. The U-shape for women results from negative associations of female involuntary childlessness with health and educational advancements, combined with positive correlations of voluntary and circumstantial childlessness with education and income improvements. While these positive associations are stronger among men than women, the negative relationships of involuntary childlessness with health and education observed for women are absent for men, resulting in an overall positive and linear relationship between development and childlessness among men. Our findings have implications for how we might expect childlessness rates to evolve with future levels of development. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Over the past 30 years, progress has been made in increasing women's representation in clinical research. However, women continue to be underrepresented in phase I clinical trials—those trials that test the safety and tolerability of investigational drugs, often on healthy individuals. As sex-based differences in adverse drug reactions are often linked to drug dose, pivotal safety information in phase I trials is often insufficiently—and inequitably—captured for females. Yet there has been little attention to how clinical investigators and those charged with overseeing the ethical conduct of these trials perceive the barriers to women's inclusion in phase I trials. To address this gap, we report on 22 interviews with U.S. phase I investigators and institutional review board (IRB) members. Our findings indicate that although these investigators and IRB members acknowledged the importance of including women in clinical trials, they justified women's exclusion from phase I trials by citing the need to manage their reproductive potential. In particular, we identified four key themes that informants used to warrant women's exclusion from phase I trials: the structure of the drug-development system itself, fears about risks to potential fetuses, distrust of women to prevent pregnancy, and concerns about risks and burdens to institutions from resulting pregnancies. We argue that these rationales reflect structural and cultural barriers to women's inclusion in clinical research that ultimately fail to respect female research participants as persons, highlighting the need for broad-based solutions. © 2023 by The Hastings Center.

	abstract = {Demographic processes such as international migration, internal rural–urban movements, and short-range residential mobility are increasingly driven by economic cycles. To assess how economic downturns have influenced demographic dynamics across regions in Greece—perhaps the European country most affected by the 2007 recession—the present study investigates spatial patterns of population increase and decline (2002–2017) in 51 prefectures, evaluating the contribution of natural balance (births minus deaths) and migration to total population growth during economic expansion (2002–2009) and recession (2010–2017). Population increased during economic expansion in semicentral regions with medium-size urban centres, upper economic functions (university and international airport), and road infrastructures. Although natural balance was positive in almost all prefectures, migration contributed the most to population growth during 2002–2009. A generalised population decline was observed during recession, except in coastal areas specialised in tourism, the only regions still attracting migratory flows and maintaining a slightly positive natural balance. The largest urban areas (Athens, Salonika) experienced the highest rate of population decline, thanks to accelerated emigration and a moderately negative natural balance. Population dynamics during economic expansion contributed to increase a traditional density gap between urban and rural areas. Conversely, population dynamics during recession led to a spatial redistribution of population, reducing the gap between urban areas and rural, tourism-specialised coastal districts. Evidence in our study supports a need for further investigation into the role of economic downturns in future population redistribution processes, specifically “shrinking” regions. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews research on education and childbearing in Europe over the last decade. Early demographic research attributed declining fertility in advanced economies in the second half of the twentieth century to increasing female educational levels. The twenty-first century has witnessed further increases in educational attainment coupled with trend reversals in fertility. The relationship between education and fertility has become more complex, sparking renewed interest in the interplay between the two life domains. We examine how educational enrolment and attainment influence individuals’ fertility behaviour – both fertility timing and level – and how the relationship between education and fertility is shaped by contextual factors such as family policies, macroeconomic shocks, and normative changes in gender attitudes. We also summarise the recent literature on educational gradients in male fertility and review methodological developments to address issues of self-selection and unmeasured heterogeneity in the study of education and fertility. Finally, this paper identifies and discusses challenges and important areas for future research. © 2023, Bundesinstitut fur Bevolkerungsforschung. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Over the past two centuries, the Dutch experienced a tremendous secular trend in height, and ultimately became the tallest nation in the world. Improving environmental conditions likely played the largest role in explaining these developments. But it is not yet precisely clear what factor set the Dutch head and shoulders above other nations, who were also experiencing improving environmental conditions. Could fertility also have played a role? To understand this, we would first need to know whether height and fertility were related during the secular growth trend. In this study, we investigated whether this was the case. A sample of Dutch men, birth years 1850–1900 (n = 3396), was examined. We tested the extents to which height was associated with having a certain number of children, and with having a certain number of children survive infancy. Multinomial logistic regressions were used. In terms of findings, height's relationship to fertility outcomes was curvilinear: being shorter-than-average (0.75–0.5 standard deviations below the mean height) was associated with a higher probability of being married and having five to seven children, while being moderately tall (0.5 standard deviations above the mean height) was associated with the lowest probability of being unmarried. There was no relationship between paternal height and children surviving infancy in the sample overall, but taller height was associated with a decreased risk of being in a high-mortality family among men born between 1880 and 1900. If paternal fertility played a role in the secular growth trend, we would expect to see very tall men have the most children, and clearly have the most children surviving infancy. Given this study's findings, it is unlikely that this was the case. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {The death of a child affects the well-being of parents and families world-wide, but little is known about the scale of this phenomenon. Using a novel methodology from formal demography applied to data from the 2019 Revision of the United Nations World Population Prospects, we provide the first global overview of parental bereavement, its magnitude, prevalence, and distribution over age for the 1950–2000 annual birth cohorts of women. We project that the global burden of parental bereavement will be 1.6 times lower for women born in 2000 than for women born in 1955. Accounting for compositional effects, we anticipate the largest improvements in regions of the Global South, where offspring mortality continues to be a common life event. This study quantifies an unprecedented shift in the timing of parental bereavement from reproductive to retirement ages. Women in the 1985 cohort and subsequent cohorts will be more likely to lose an adult child after age 65 than to lose a young child before age 50, reversing a long-standing global trend. “Child death” will increasingly come to mean the death of adult offspring. We project persisting regional inequalities in offspring mortality and in the availability of children in later life, a particular concern for parents dependent on support from their children after retirement. Nevertheless, our analyses suggest a progressive narrowing of the historical gap between the Global North and South in the near future. These developments have profound implications for demographic theory and highlight the need for policies to support bereaved older parents. © 2021 The Authors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Levels and patterns of male fertility are poorly documented in developing countries. Demographic accounts of male fertility focus primarily on developed countries, and where such accounts do exist for developing countries they are mainly available at the local or regional level. OBJECTIVE We show how data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) can be used to compute age-specific male fertility rates. Three methods are described and compared: the own-children method, the date-of-last-birth method, and the crisscross method. Male and female fertility rates are compared using the own-children method. RESULTS Male fertility estimates produced using the own-children method emerge as the most trustworthy. The data needed for this method is widely available and makes it possible to document male fertility in a large number of developing countries. The date-of-lastbirth method also appears worthwhile, and may be especially useful for analyzing fertility differentials. The crisscross method is less reliable, but may be of interest for ages below 40. Comparisons of male and female fertility show that reproductive experiences differ across gender in most developing countries: Male fertility is substantially higher than female fertility, and males have their children later than females. CONTRIBUTION This study shows that Demographic and Health Surveys constitute a valuable and untapped source of data that can be used to document male fertility in a large number of countries. Male fertility rates are markedly different from female fertility rates in developing countries, and documenting both male and female fertility provides a more complete picture of fertility. © 2017 Bruno Schoumaker.},

The paper then describes the Fatherhood Initiative, a set of activities that stemmed from a 1995 memorandum from President Clinton. This Initiative led to coordinated efforts by U.S. Federal Statistical agencies to collect better data about fathers. The paper concludes with a discussion of what we know about the effects on father involvement of policies such as welfare reform, child support, work place policies, responsible fatherhood programs, and other fatherhood interventions.

Unlike the situation that occurs in the study of fertility, there is no reason to give a preference to either of the sexes. To address the fundamental problem caused by the two-sex nature of the process, a solution is proposed that considers the sexes jointly. The solution relies on a novel use of generalized averages. The model is formulated in stochastic terms, and it is parametrized in terms of the overall level of nuptiality, the relative propensity of nuptiality by age, and the mutual relative attraction of spouses at different ages. Although national statistics collection relies on data aggregated by age groups, the models are formulated at individual levels to show how estimation could also be carried out in small populations. In particular, examples of how maximum likelihood estimation can be carried out are given for specific parametric models. The methods are illustrated by both monthly and annual nuptiality data from Finland. © American Sociological Association 2015.},

The unique characteristics of families with MPF present data and other logistical challenges to researchers studying the phenomenon. Drawing from recent studies and updated data, I present new estimates of MPF that show that about 13 percent of men aged 40 to 44 and 19 percent of women aged 41 to 49 have children with more than one partner, with a higher prevalence among the disadvantaged. Compared to parents with two or more children by only one partner, people with MPF become parents at younger ages, largely with unintended first births, and often do so outside of marriage. This article touches on the implications of MPF for families and concludes by discussing the theoretical difficulties in studying MPF and the challenges it presents to public policy. © 2014 by The American Academy of Political and Social Science.},

	abstract = {Our study focuses on the fertility of first-generation female and male Turkish migrants in Germany. To evaluate whether timing effects such as fertility disruption or an interrelation of marriage, migration and childbirth occur, we examine first and second births in the years before and after immigration to Germany. The Turkish sample of the Generations and Gender Survey which was conducted in 2006 offers the unique opportunity to examine Turkish immigrants as a single immigrant category. We question the common understanding that Turkish immigrants who arrived to Germany after 1973 mainly arrived for family reunification resulting in high birth intensities immediately after immigration. To distinguish different circumstances under which male and female immigrants have arrived to Germany, we include the combined marriage and migration history of the couple. We find that first birth probabilities are elevated during the years immediately following migration. But this effect is not universal among migrants with different marriage and migration histories. It appears that the arrival effect of high birth intensities is particularly high among female immigrants and is evident only among marriage migrants, that is Turks who married a partner who already lived in Germany at the time of the wedding. By contrast, among those who immigrated for family reunification, we do not find such an arrival effect. © 2016, The Author(s).},

The impact of education is studied in terms of the interaction thereof with various other characteristics of the individual.

The same respondents were interviewed three times, in 2005, 2008 and 2011. Although the survey was designed to avoid redundant questions from one wave to the next, a respondent's family situation is likely to change over time. In each wave respondents were therefore asked about their children living in the dwelling, those living elsewhere and those deceased. The results of these separate questionnaire modules were then summed to give the total number of children (no direct question about the total was included). Substantial under-reporting of children in Waves 2 and 3 of the French survey was observed. This article aims to measure the extent of the omissions in order to alert potential users of the data, to identify which children "disappear" and establish whether this corresponds to particular respondent profiles. More broadly, the study calls into question the method of summing the children recorded in various parts of the same questionnaire in order to determine the respondent's total number of children, and suggests that similar verifications should be made in other GGS surveys. © Institut national d'études démographiques (INED).},

We argue that the inconsistency of findings for men is due to the fact that the selection process involved in union formation has been disregarded in earlier studies. We hypothesize that men’s educational attainment consistently and positively affects the transition to fatherhood via higher rates of union formation. We apply multiprocess event-history analysis to data from the Generations and Gender Surveys for 10 European countries. Our results show indeed a consistent positive effect of education on the transition to fatherhood, but it operates chiefly through selection into union. Failing to account for this selection process leads to a major underestimation of the salience of education for the transition to fatherhood. © 2017, Population Association of America.},

I illustrate how men's diverse institutional roles surrounding medicalized experiences of infertility are critical for understanding inequality in reproduction. Situating research on men and infertility in the theoretical framework of gender as social structure shows how men's secondary position in reproduction can be seen across institutional roles, which include men as patients, men as partners, men as sperm donors, and men as doctors. Men's experiences with reproductive medicine often reinforce men's marginal position in reproductive medicine through institutionalized arrangements; yet, men are intimately and structurally involved in reproductive decisions. I argue that bringing gender to the center of research on infertility could make clear the many structural ways women and women's bodies are controlled, regulated, and treated by reproductive medicine. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A key feature of the Generations & Gender Programme (GGP) is that longitudinal micro-data from the Generations and Gender Surveys (GGS) can be combined with indicators from the Contextual Database (CDB) that provide information on the macro-level context in which people live. This allows researchers to consider the impact of socio-cultural, economic, and policy contexts on changing demographic behaviour since the 1970s. The validity of longitudinal analyses combining individual-level and contextual data depends, however, on whether the micro-data give a correct account of demographic trends after 1970. OBJECTIVE: This article provides information on the quality of retrospective longitudinal data on first marriage and fertility in the first wave of the GGS. METHODS: Using the union and fertility histories recorded in the GGS, we compare period indicators of women's nuptiality and fertility behaviour for the period 1970-2005 and cohort indicators of nuptiality and fertility for women born after 1925 to population statistics. RESULTS: Results suggest that, in general, period indicators estimated retrospectively from the GGS are fairly accurate from the 1970s onwards, allowing exceptions for specific indicators in specific countries. Cohort indicators, however, were found to be less accurate for cohorts born before 1945, suggesting caution when using the GGS to study patterns of union and family formation in these older cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of the validity of demographic data in the GGS provides country-specific information on time periods and birth cohorts for which GGS estimates deviate from population statistics. Researchers may use this information to decide on the observation period or cohorts to include in their analysis, or use the results as a starting point for a more detailed analysis of item nonresponse in union and fertility histories, which may further improve the quality of GGS estimates, particularly for these earlier periods and older birth cohorts.

We contribute to this debate comparing religiosity and gender attitudes over several European countries using three waves of the European Values Study (1990, 1999 and 2008). By dealing with the issues of measurement invariance and endogeneity between values and behaviour, our results support some critiques of the SDT theory. The pace of the process of sociocultural change has not been the same across European countries and the forerunners of the SDT, that is, the most secularized and gender-egalitarian societies, now have the highest female labour market participation rates and the highest fertility. We provide evidence for a ‘macro–micro paradox’ regarding the role of values on family behaviours. Religiosity is positively correlated with fertility and housewifery, while gender attitudes are only correlated with women’s labour market decisions. These correlations are stronger in more traditional countries, even if aggregate fertility is lower. We stress the necessity to integrate cultural and structural explanations, suggesting the lack of family policies and the rigidity of the family formation process as possible mechanisms to unravel this paradox. © The Author(s) 2015},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND While women's participation in higher education has caught up with and surpassed that of men, large gender differences persist in the choice of field of study. To date, we know little about the mechanisms that explain the link between fertility and study disciplines for both men and women. OBJECTIVE To study gender differences in the effect on fertility of earnings potential and gender composition in study disciplines. METHODS We used European Labor Force Survey (EU-LFS) data and OLS models to estimate earnings potential. Next, we linked these estimates to the Generations and Gender Surveys (GGS) of six countries and applied piecewise linear hazard models to analyze the transition to first and second births jointly. RESULTS We found heterogeneity across countries, but within countries the mechanisms tend to be similar for both men and women. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that the drivers of men's and women's family behavior may be more similar than is often expected. Societal changes that have occurred in the last three decades may lead to a stronger role for men in fertility decision-making, which may remain unnoticed if we continue to focus only on women. CONTRIBUTION This study expands our knowledge of the relationship between men's education and fertility. It also broadens our understanding of the effect of the field of study on the fertility of both men and women by considering two characteristics of the study discipline: earnings potential and gender composition.

	abstract = {This research investigates the effect of sun exposure on fertility, with a special focus on how its effects and consequences for birth outcomes may differ by race. Sun exposure is a key mechanism for obtaining Vitamin D, but this process is inhibited by skin pigmentation. Vitamin D has been linked to male and female fertility and risk of miscarriage, and Vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent among blacks than whites. Using 1989–2004 individual live births data from the Natality Detail Files, county-level, monthly conceptions are estimated as a function of monthly solar insolation, temperature and humidity, as well as month, time and location fixed effects and controls. Insolation has positive, statistically significant effects on fertility for both non-Hispanic blacks and whites, but the effects are stronger and the pattern of effect different for black mothers than white mothers. Poisson estimates from the main model suggest that a 1 kWh increase in average daily insolation in the conception month – approximately the difference in sunshine experienced in the typical September vs. October – increases non-Hispanic black conceptions by 1% and non-Hispanic white conceptions by 0.6%. Allowing insolation's effect to differ by maternal characteristic suggests that the racial differences are not being driven by differences in socioeconomic status (SES). Models that allow for more complicated timing of insolation's effect further suggest that insolation pushes black (white) conceptions into the unfavorable (favorable) season of birth. These estimated effects and our decomposition analyses suggest that insolation – and the implied Vitamin D deficiency underlying its effect–helps explain why black conceptions are more likely to display a seasonal pattern that is disadvantageous to birth outcomes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The results, despite the vast differences in method and philosophical orientation that typically separate demography and anthropology, are forging new ways to look at fertility.

Building on the theoretical frameworks of relative resource theory and gender perspectives, this study investigates the association between partners' power (measured as their relative education, division of housework and decision-making) and the choice of male versus female, or no contraception. Data from the Generations and Gender Survey for four Western European countries (Austria, Belgium, France and Germany; 2005–2010) are used to examine the hypotheses with multinomial logistic diagonal reference models. The results show that man's and woman's educational level are equally important predictors for a couple's contraceptive method choice. Furthermore, the findings suggest that households in which the man performs more housework or the woman has more say in decisions are more likely to rely on male methods or female sterilization, rather than on the more commonly used female reversible methods. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

With the sex composition of the two firstborn children as an instrumental variable, we estimate the effect of sibship size on adult fertility using high-quality data from Norwegian administrative registers. Our study sample is all firstborns or second-borns during the 1960s in Norwegian families with at least two children (approximately 110,000 men and 104,000 women). An additional sibling has a positive effect on male fertility, mainly causing them to have three children themselves, but has a negative effect on female fertility at the same margin. Investigation into mediators reveals that mothers of girls shift relatively less time from market to family work when an additional child is born. We speculate that this scarcity in parents’ time makes girls aware of the strains of life in large families, leading them to limit their own number of children in adulthood. © 2016, Population Association of America.},

Moreover, it is not known what parities contribute to the higher CFR among more highly educated men. Objective: To describe men's fertility by age, parity, and education in Finland. Methods: The study is based on register data covering the male cohort born in 1940-1950 (N=38,838). Education was measured at ages 30?34 and classified as basic, lower secondary, upper secondary, and tertiary. Fertility was measured until ages 59-69. We calculated completed and age-specific fertility rates, and decomposed the educational gradient in CFR into parity-specific contributions. Results: The more highly educated men had more children (CFR: basic 1.71 and tertiary 2.06), had them later (mean age at having the first child: basic 26.1 and tertiary 28.1), and had them within a shorter interval (interquartile range of age at having the first child: basic 5.8 and tertiary 5.2). The educational gradient in the cumulative fertility rate was negative at young ages but turned positive by the early thirties. High levels of childlessness among those with a basic education explained three-quarters of the CFR difference between the lowest and highest educational groups. Fertility at ages above 45 was low and did not widen the educational gradient in CFR. Conclusions: The fact that highly educated men have more children than their counterparts with less education is largely attributable to higher fertility levels at older ages and the lower probability of remaining childless. Variation in fertility timing and quantity is wider among men with a low level of education. © 2014 Nisén, Martikainen, Silventoinen and Myrskylä.},

Cross-country comparisons show that when parenting and employment are in conflict, this relationship is less positive for women. We lack knowledge of how this relationship is shaped by context for men and how it varies with contextual changes over time rather than between countries. Objective: I investigate how the relationship between earnings and first-birth probability changes over time for men and women, in a period when efforts in parenting and paid work become increasingly similar across sex. Methods: Discrete-time hazard regressions are applied to highly accurate data from Norwegian population registers. Through estimation of separate models for each of the years 1995 through 2010, I assess whether the correlation between yearly earnings and the first birth probabilities changed over period time. The correlation is estimated net of observable confounders, such as educational enrolment and attainment and region of birth. Results: The correlation between earnings and fertility has become substantially more positive over time for women, and also somewhat more positive among men. Conclusions: Though the potential opportunity cost of fathering increases, there is no evidence of a weaker correlation between earnings and first birth probability for men. I suggest that decreasing opportunity costs of motherhood as well as strategic timing of fertility are both plausible explanations for the increasingly positive correlation among women. © 2015 Rannveig Kaldager Hart.},

	abstract = {Globally, women experience a disproportionate burden of disease and death due to inequities in access to basic health care, nutrition, and education. In the face of this disparity, it is striking that leadership in the field of global health is highly skewed towards men and that global health organizations neglect the issue of gender equality in their own leadership. Randomized trials demonstrate that women in leadership positions in governmental organizations implement different policies than men and that these policies are more supportive of women and children. Other studies show that proactive interventions to increase the proportion of women in leadership positions within businesses or government can be successful. Therefore, the authors assert that increasing female leadership in global health is both feasible and a fundamental step towards addressing the problem of women's health. In this Perspective, the authors contrast the high proportion of young female trainees who are interested in academic global health early in their careers with the low numbers of women successfully rising to global health leadership roles. The authors subsequently explore reasons for female attrition from the field of global health and offer practical strategies for closing the gender gap in global health leadership. The authors propose solutions aimed to promote female leaders from both resource-wealthy and resource-poor countries, including leadership training grants, mentorship from female leaders in global professions, strengthening health education in resource-poor countries, research-enabling grants, and altering institutional policies to support women choosing a global health career path.},

Clearly explaining technical demographic issues without using extensive mathematics, Population and Society is sociologically oriented, but incorporates a variety of social sciences in its approach, including economics, political science, geography, and history. It highlights the significant impact of decision-making at the individual level - especially regarding fertility, but also mortality and migration - on population change. The text engages students by providing numerous examples of demography’s practical applications in their lives, and demonstrates the extent of its relevance by examining a wide selection of data from the United States, Africa, Asia, and Europe.

	abstract = {The level of education and other adult socioeconomic characteristics of men are known to associate with their fertility, but early-life socioeconomic characteristics may also be related. We studied how men’s adult and early-life socioeconomic characteristics are associated with their eventual fertility and whether the differences therein by educational level are explained or mediated by other socioeconomic characteristics. The data on men born in 1940–1950 (N = 37,082) were derived from the 1950 Finnish census, which is linked to later registers. Standard and sibling fixed-effects Poisson and logistic regression models were used. Education and other characteristics were positively associated with the number of children, largely stemming from a higher likelihood of a first birth among the more socioeconomically advantaged men. The educational gradient in the number of children was not explained by early socioeconomic or other characteristics shared by brothers, but occupational position and income in adulthood mediated approximately half of the association. Parity-specific differences existed: education and many other socioeconomic characteristics predicted the likelihood of a first birth more strongly than that of a second birth, and the mediating role of occupational position and income was also strongest for first births. Relatively small differences were found in the likelihood of a third birth. In men, education is positively associated with eventual fertility after controlling for early socioeconomic and other characteristics shared by brothers. Selective entry into fatherhood based on economic provider potential may contribute considerably to educational differentials in the number of children among men. © 2017, The Author(s).},

However, less is known about the influence of parental SES in other Western countries. The current paper examines the association between parental educational attainment with the partnership context at first birth in 16 European and North American countries, by differentiating births within marriage, within cohabitation, or while being single. Moreover, we test whether the association between parental education and partnership context at childbirth changes over cohorts and whether its influence changes when controlling for own educational attainment. Data from the Generations and Gender Programme were used, as well as data from the American National Survey of Family Growth, the Canadian General Social Survey, and the Dutch Survey on Family Formation. The results show that in North American and East European countries, but not in West European countries, lower parental education increases the risk of having a birth within cohabitation. Moreover, in North American countries and half of the West and East European countries, lower parental education increases the risk of having a birth while being single. The association of parental education with the partnership context at birth tends to change furthermore over cohorts, although no clear pattern could be observed between countries. The study suggests that the intergenerational transmission of education is an important mechanism in explaining the influence of parental education, although other mechanisms also appear to be at work. © 2017, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This chapter is a rethinking of the analysis of exogamy and endogamy with a new approach to the adaptive benefits of the latter. Bateson’s principle of optimal inbreeding in plants and animals leads to the definition of mediogamy (close-cousin marriage) as the human equivalent. Incest avoidance is examined as the driver of human exogamy and as a form of dispersion subject to general laws of fragmentation and dispersion. Hie basic forms ofexogamic marriage, the human phenomenon of endogamy through parallel cousin marriage, and dispersion in animals and humans and its relationship to the preservation of the optimal number (after Malthus) are examined. The possibility that a mechanism other than resource optimization is responsible for population segmentation and dispersion across species, namely, optimization of fertility by consanguineous mating, is examined. Data from four taxa (mammals, birds, fish, and insects) and from human birth records suggest that the same underlying mechanisms are present from single-celled organisms to humans governing population fluctuations and fragmentation that has to do with preserving levels of fertility through optimal inbreeding and losing them through dilution of consanguinity. This challenges the Malthusian resource-based para-digm and makes mediogamy the optimal strategy in human mating systems. Hie consequences of its decline for fertility levels in current populations are examined. © 2015, Taylor & Francis. All rights reserved.},

OBJECTIVE Our aim in this paper is to enrich the discussion about variation in crisis-driven fertility patterns by focusing on male fertility, and by comparing the fertility behavioral patterns and the compositional factors of male and female fertility under "Great Recession" conditions. METHODS We estimate the education- and employment-specific fertility rates of men and women for the 2000-2014 period in Greece. Using a mixed standardization and decomposition method, we estimate the influence of changes in educational levels and employment status on total male and female fertility, which we call the "compositional effect;" and of changes in fertility behavior, which we call the "fertility effect." RESULTS During the recent economic recession, the decline in fertility has been far from uniform across genders, educational levels, and employment statuses. Moreover, it appears that the changes in male and female fertility rates have been driven by different underlying forces. We find that among men, negative shifts in employability were exclusively responsible for the decline in fertility rates; whereas among women, changes in the TFR were steadily conditioned by the pure fertility effect. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the compositional effect on the period total fertility rate might be more important than fertility behavior per se, especially during time periods when economic variables clearly contribute to fertility outcomes. © 2017 Christos Bagavos & Alexandra Tragiki.},

Whether it's triclosan in toothpaste, formaldehyde in baby shampoo, endocrine disruptors in water bottles, or pesticides on strawberries, chemicals in food and personal care products are of increasing concern to consumers. This book chronicles how ordinary people try to avoid exposure to toxics in grocery store aisles using the practice of "precautionary consumption." Through an innovative analysis of environmental regulation, the advocacy work of environmental health groups, the expansion of the health-food chain Whole Foods Market, and interviews with consumers, Norah MacKendrick ponders why the problem of toxics in the U.S. retail landscape has been left to individual shoppers-and to mothers in particular. She reveals how precautionary consumption, or "green shopping," is a costly and time-intensive practice, one that is connected to cultural ideas of femininity and good motherhood but is also most available to upper- and middle-class households. Better Safe Than Sorry powerfully argues that precautionary consumption places a heavy and unfair burden of labor on women and does little to advance environmental justice or mitigate risk. © 2018 by Norah MacKendrick.},

This paper investigates the fertility of marriages of German men and their marriage migrant spouses from poorer countries, using a database of 268 German-German couples and 461 couples made up of German men and women from Thailand, Brazil, Poland and Russia. The results show that marriage migrants' fertility is far below that of German-German couples. To a large part, this can be attributed to the partnership biography of husband and wife–especially when considering children from former relationships and a higher age at partnership formation. Bi-national marriages in which the husband is familiar with the wife's culture are more inclined to have children. If the husband speaks the wife's native language well and if he lived abroad prior to meeting his wife, childbirth is more probable than if he is ignorant of the wife's culture and always resided in his native country. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

In addition, using published descriptive census tables for women in the reproductive lifespan, 15-49, data on children ever born or parity (P) derived were evaluated for incorrect reporting of parities using the el-Badry technique. Further, the relational Gompertz model was applied to adjust data on reported aggregated births in the last year or current fertility (F) relying on its intrinsic P/F ratios feature as an adjustment and diagnostic tool for consistency checks on fertility and parity distributions. The evidence of some age reporting distortions or age misreporting is not too severe, but moderate, and therefore fertility estimates in the four censuses of Swaziland cannot be said are invalidated.

Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth–1979 Cohort from 1979 to 2002 (N = 28,514 observations), separate effects are estimated based on fathers’ marital status and coresidence with own children. Only unmarried men who became fathers before 24 years work longer hours immediately after a first birth, but in the long run, most early fathers work fewer hours as a result of parenthood. Over time, unmarried but coresident men who became fathers between 24 and 29 years increase their hours, as do married, coresident men who delayed fatherhood until 30 years or older. However, the latter increase is moderated by support for egalitarian gender roles. The findings shed light on the contemporary transition to adulthood and on men’s work–family balance. © The Author(s) 2013.},

A Poisson regression is used to analyze data from the fourth wave of the European Values Study, with the number of children as the dependent variable. The association between education and fertility is found to be generally negative and stronger for women. The findings also indicate that opportunity costs and liberal values are stronger predictors of fertility among women than among men, and largely explain the more negative effect of education on women. Additional analysis of different welfare regimes reveals that the multivariate association between education and fertility remains significant only for the post-communist countries of Europe. © Vienna Yearbook of Population Research 2017.},

Research reinforces such divergence, as men are seldom included in studies of reproduction, and when they are included, studies often highlight their differences from women’s experiences. While such differences do exist, it is important to have a more nuanced understanding of reproduction, including examining why there is such difference, as well as recognizing similarities. Thus, in centering rather than marginalizing men’s voices in reproduction, this study reveals the commonalities across reproductive experiences. Through 43 in-depth interviews with men and women who have experienced infertility, the findings reveal that infertility has both physical and emotional implications for men as it does for women. Ironically, men’s reconciliation with those parallels further silences their experience and perpetuates difference. Exposing such effects extends understandings of infertility, reproduction, and gender. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {The medicinal properties of tea (Camellia sinensis L.) have a long and interesting history, dating back to many centuries ago. Green tea has aroused considerable interest in recent years, being nowadays one of the most studied types of teas. Green tea is a complex mixture of thousands of chemical compounds, including proteins and free amino acids, polysaccharides, vitamins, organic acids, methylxanthines, and polyphenols. Catechins, caffeine and L-theanine are often reported as the main phytochemicals responsible for green tea's health benefits, namely by its antioxidant, hypoglycemic, and neuroprotective properties. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the most common metabolic disease and its incidence is dramatically rising. In addition, DM is associated to a high risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases, since the brain is particularly susceptible to glucose fluctuations and hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative stress. Throughout this chapter we will discuss the phytochemical composition and bioactivities of green tea, especially antioxidant, antidiabetic, and neuroprotective activities. The potential beneficial effects of green tea consumption on DM and how it can be used to reduce the severe brain damage induced by this disease will be emphasized. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

This study aims to contribute to the debate on the influence of structural and situational variables on fertility in low-fertility countries and extends the debate by introducing the viewpoint of male reproduction. The aim is to identify the factors influencing the transition to fatherhood among Czech men and to discuss intergenerational changes in reproductive patterns. The data employed are taken from the Czech Generations and Gender Survey (2008). The transition to first child was analysed using the event history modelling method. The results revealed that the transition to fatherhood is positively influenced by co-residence partnerships (especially marriage), by having completed a tertiary-level education and by living independently. Conversely, the likelihood is significantly reduced by student status, the absence of a relationship, and having a considerably older partner. Employing the cohort approach, it was determined that the factors which influence male transition to first birth change over time. The clear linear impact of education on the transition to fatherhood apparent with respect to older cohorts no longer applies. Moreover, the influence of the family of origin, which made up a significant factor with respect to older cohorts, has all but disappeared in the youngest cohorts. Only marriage retains its dominant role with concern to predicting the transition to fatherhood across all cohorts. © The Author(s) 2018.},

Methods: All original articles published in nine demographic journals from Africa, Europe, Australia, Canada and United States were reviewed. We derived yearly aggregate for total number of articles and number of technical demographic papers from 1994 to 2015. We illustrated the trends in the proportion of technical demographic studies in a graph and also estimated the annual rate of decline using least square regression techniques. Results: A total of 4091 studies were published in 465 issues of the selected journals between 1994 and 2015 of which 371 (9.0%) were related to technical demography. The proportion of technical demographic papers declined gradually at an annual rate of 0.42% (Cl= 0.29-0.62) between 1994 (12.0%) and 2015(10.0%). Conclusion: Technical demography need to be strengthened in order to provide the critical data and evidence required to objectively monitor the post-2015 development goals. © 2019, University of Granada.

This study identifies differences in short-term demographic trends before and during the 2007 recession in a metropolitan area of southern Europe. Using vital statistics, indicators were calculated over two distinct time intervals representative of expansion (2000–2007) and recession (2008–2014) waves in Athens, Greece, at the spatial scale of municipalities. Local-scale changes in population dynamics were considered key indicators to evaluate the crisis' impact on recent urban transformations. Demographic polarisations in urban and rural areas have progressively increased the gap between wealthy and economically disadvantaged districts. In Athens, short-term population dynamics were influenced by a combination of socioeconomic factors and processes acting at different spatial scales due to suburbanisation, recession, and demographic transition. As a result, the use of nonlinear analysis proves to be a useful tool to investigate urban systems in their complexity and supports the debate over the future development of contemporary cities.

Demographic literature had established the existence of preponderance of factors sustaining a high level of fertility in the country. Most previous studies on fertility had focused on women, and a few that examined male fertility behaviour focused mainly on individual-level factors, ignoring the influence of community contexts. This study, therefore, examined the influence of an individual, household and community level factors on male fertility behaviour in Nigeria. Data source and Methods: The study used male data from 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). Results: Results showed that community variables like region, ethnic diversity, community family-size norm and community-level of education significantly influenced male fertility behaviour in Nigeria (p<0.05). Conclusion: The study thus established community contexts as an important factor influencing male fertility behaviour, and this factor must be taken into consideration in the efforts to reduce the fertility level in Nigeria. © 2018, University of Granada.

Nonetheless, the research identified a small but important minority of progressive males who questioned traditional machista attitudes. In focus group discussions, more progressive males were frequently criticized by machista males. Individual in-depth interviews found that being able to question predominant machista values was related to having a meaningful relationship with a role model who promoted nontraditional gender roles.

A growing number of investigations show that life-style changes resulting from nutritional, toxicological, and psychological stresses are reflected in changes in the epigenetic profile of individuals, and that learning and memory have epigenetic correlates. Moreover, various types of epigenetic changes can be inherited and affect the characters of descendants. Studying epigenetics can forge new experimental and conceptual bridges between biology, the social sciences and the humanities. For example, new techniques that allow the deciphering of methylation patterns in ancient DNA could be used to study the epigenetics of human cultures in long-gone historical periods, thus enriching and extending our knowledge of human history. Conceptually, an epigenetic perspective blurs traditional distinctions such as those between nature and nurture, plasticity and evolvability. © 2016 Sociological Review Publication Limited.},

Taking into account the growing diversity of life course and residency patterns for men and children today, we stress how the definition of fatherhood and conceptualization of paternal involvement are interwoven. As our starting point, we highlight how diverse stakeholders construct differing images and types of fatherhood during an era when men are " doing fatherhood” in a wide range of contexts. Next, we explore issues associated with a broad conceptualization of father involvement, influence, and motivation with an eye toward fatherhood diversity. We then consider how several family processes are implicated in the way men develop, negotiate, and sustain their rights, privileges, and obligations as fathers in different types of family structures. We conclude by suggesting how our treatment of these issues can guide future research on fatherhood. [Article copies available for a fee from The Haworth Document Delivery Service: 1-800-342-9678.

Objective: The objective is to present a demographic overview of the fertility trends of Danish men and women from 1980 to 2010. We review the differences in male and female fertility and perform separate tempo corrections for fathers and mothers. Methods: The material for this study consisted of basic data on male and female fertility. The data included all children born in the period, specified by birth year of the child and age and parity of the mother and father, respectively. We used standard demographic measurements of fertility, primarily the total fertility rate (TFR) and the tempo-corrections as proposed by Bongaarts and Feeney (1998). Results: The female fertility rates were generally higher than those for males, but the TFRs of both Danish men and women generally increased over the period. The unadjusted and the adjusted fertility rates had similar patterns for men and women. A negative tempo-effect was more evident for women than for men, and a vanishing effect for men at the end of the period was not similarly observed for women. Conclusions: We have exemplified tempo corrections for male as well as female fertility, and have discussed specific problems in this context. Our study indicates that the postponement of childbearing is about to end for Danish men. © 2015 Francisca Nordfalk, U.A. Hvidtfeldt, and N. Keiding.},

Our analysis emphasizes the dynamic interplay between social structures and processes at the macro, meso, and micro levels while focusing on social psychological issues. We examine (a) the social, organizational, and cultural contexts for fathering, (b) fathers’ social capital contributions, (c) the construction and maintenance of father identities, and (d) fathering as a co-constructed accomplishment. These foci draw attention to how father involvement is affected by race, gender, economic considerations and a father’s relationships with his child’s mother and others in the community. We also examine how reflected appraisals of others may affect how a man perceives himself as a father. Relying heavily on qualitative approaches such as in-depth interviews, discourse analysis, interpretive practice, narrative practice, and dramaturgy, we suggest a number of ways a sociological lens can inform our understanding of father involvement.

	abstract = {The state of Tennessee arrested a woman two days after she gave birth and charged her with assault of her newborn child based on her use of narcotics during her pregnancy. Tennessee's 2014 assault statute was the first to explicitly criminalize the use of drugs by a pregnant woman. But this law, along with others like it being considered by legislatures across the country, is only the most recent manifestation of a long history of using criminal law to punish poor mothers and mothers of color for their behavior while pregnant. The purported motivation for such laws is the harm to the child from prenatal exposure to illegal drugs. But recent scientific studies undermine the harm narrative. This Article is the first to take a close look at the science behind these laws. Recent longitudinal studies confirm that the use of illegal drugs while pregnant, in and of itself, rarely results in long-term adverse consequences to the fetus and subsequent child. Meanwhile, the negative consequences of ingesting licit substances such as tobacco, alcohol, and other lawfully prescribed medications, often are much greater than the potential undesirable effects of drug use. Poverty, domestic violence, and a father's behavior prior to conception also have been shown to have significant harmful impacts on fetal development. Although the criminalization of drug use by pregnant women does not prevent impairment of the fetus and subsequent child, it often leads to additional detrimental consequences. The state regularly steps in and removes children born to women using illicit drugs while pregnant, even when there is no evidence of harm to the child and despite the documented harms to newborns from placement in the foster care system. Additionally, as every major medical organization has publicly indicated, pregnant women are less likely to seek prenatal care if they fear arrest for using drugs, creating damaging effects greater than any potential harms from the drug use. Legislatures' unwillingness to acknowledge the empirical evidence contradicting the rationales for this latest batch of criminal laws might cause one to wonder whether the harm to the child is truly the motivating impetus behind these laws. The existing statutes have a disproportionate impact on poor mothers and mothers of. Copyright © 2017 Cortney E. Lollar.},

First, what factors predict father involvement among nonresident fathers of young children who receive welfare? And second, is nonresident father involvement associated with better outcomes for these children? The three measures of nonresident father involvement examined are father-child visitation, formal child support payments received through the welfare office, and informal child support, such as money given directly to the mother, groceries, clothes, or other items. Findings reveal that while only 16.6% of fathers provided child support through the formal system during the past year, a considerably larger proportion, 42.3%, provided informal child support, and 67% visited at least once in the past year. Informal support and father-child visitation are the most highly correlated forms of involvement, and they share many of the same predictors. Only two predictors are significant and in the same direction for all three measures of nonresident father involvement. Father’s residence in the same state as the focal child and the provision of support for the child from the father’s family are associated with a higher likelihood of his involvement. In general, findings for the child well-being measures show that monetary and material contributions from the father, especially contributions provided informally, are positively associated with more positive child wellbeing outcomes.

	abstract = {Individual age estimation is a key factor in forensic science analysis that can provide very useful information applicable to criminal, legal, and anthropological investigations. Forensic age inference was initially based on morphological inspection or radiography and only later began to adopt molecular approaches. However, a lack of accuracy or technical problems hampered the introduction of these DNA-based methodologies in casework analysis. A turning point occurred when the epigenetic signature of DNA methylation was observed to gradually change during an individual´s lifespan. In the last four years, the number of publications reporting DNAmethylation age-correlated changes has gradually risen and the forensic community now has a range of age methylation tests applicable to forensic casework. Most forensic age predictor models have been developed based on blood DNA samples, but additional tissues are now also being explored. This review assesses the most widely adopted genes harboring methylation sites, detection technologies, statistical age-predictive analyses, and potential causes of variation in age estimates. Despite the need for further work to improve predictive accuracy and establishing a broader range of tissues for which tests can analyze the most appropriate methylation sites, several forensic age predictors have now been reported that provide consistency in their prediction accuracies (predictive error of ±4 years); this makes them compelling tools with the potential to contribute key information to help guide criminal investigations. opy. © 2017 Central Police University Press.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Research on fertility differentials between eastern and western Germany after German reunification in 1990 has focused on the fertility of women. Trends in the fertility of men are rarely studied due to data constraints and methodological challenges. OBJECTIVE This paper aims to close this gap by analyzing fertility differentials between eastern and western German males over the period 1991-2013. We consider different approaches to estimate male fertility and investigate variation in fertility trends, levels, and timing. METHODS We use German birth register data to estimate age-specific fertility rates and total fertility rates. As the paternal age is unknown for a non-negligible proportion of births, we compare imputation techniques and conduct sensitivity analyses. For the population at risk we employ adjusted numbers that attempt to account for the overcount in the population of childbearing age in the 1990s and the 2000s. RESULTS The trends and differences in the fertility of eastern and western German men are roughly similar to those observed among women. However, male fertility levels are lower, and male and female fertility vary in terms of timing. The total fertility rate of eastern German males in 1994 of 0.74 is likely to represent a record low. Whereas the fertility levels of eastern German women recently surpassed those of western German women, the fertility levels of eastern German men are still lower than those of their western German counterparts. CONTRIBUTION We compare methods to estimate male fertility trends. © 2016 Christian Dudel & Sebastian Klüsener.},

This is mainly due to the perceived poor state of vital registration data. Although there is general agreement about fertility trends in the country, there remain confl icting views about levels of fertilty (Moultrie and Dorrington, 2004; Moultrie and Timaeus, 2003; Udjo, 2005). The indirect estimation methodologies used to derive fertility rates from data collected in censuses and surveys require adjustment to the data, resulting in confl icting estimates of fertility.

Yet, the evidence base presents mixed findings. Using data from the U.S. National Survey of Family Growth, we employ a measure of pregnancy intentions that incorporates the extent of mistiming, as well as the desire scale developed by Santelli et al. (Studies in Family Planning, 40, 87–100, 2009). Second, we examine variation in the characteristics of mothers within intention status groups. Third, we account for the association of mothers’ background characteristics with their pregnancy intentions and with the outcomes by employing propensity score weighting. We find that weighting eliminated statistical significance of many observed associations of intention status with maternal behaviors and birth outcomes, but not all. Mistimed and unwanted births were still less likely to be recognized early in pregnancy than intended ones. Fewer unwanted births received early prenatal care or were breast-fed, and unwanted births were also more likely than intended births to be of low birth weight. Relative to births at the highest level of the desire scale, all other births were significantly less likely to be recognized early in pregnancy and to receive early prenatal care. © 2015, The Author(s).},

Information on the possible effects of other maternal characteristics and of the age of the father is even scarcer. OBJECTIVE We present new results on the associations between parental ages and other maternal characteristics on the one hand, and congenital anomalies on the other, using linked data from three Czech registries on mothers, newborns, and malformations, for the period 2000-2007. METHODS As the variables are in a categorical format, binary logistic regression is used in order to investigate the relationship between the presence/absence of a congenital anomaly for each of the 11 types of anomalies considered, and for the set of predictors. RESULTS This research confirms that the age of the mother has an impact on the incidence of Down syndrome and other chromosomal anomalies. Paternal age is not associated with chromosomal anomalies, and, in this Czech population, has a rather slight effect on some of the congenital anomalies examined. Another finding of the present study is that various other maternal characteristics may affect the incidence of congenital malformations. CONCLUSIONS Based on a large dataset, this study concludes that the ages of both parents can be associated with congenital anomalies of the child, and that maternal characteristics other than age have also to be considered. COMMENTS Risk factors can be tentatively proposed if they are based on a plausible and suitably tested explanatory mechanism. Unfortunately, in the majority of individual cases of congenital anomaly, the cause of the condition is unknown, and is suspected to result from an interaction of multiple environmental and genetic factors. © 2013 Jitka Rychtaříková et al.},

This article addresses the question of a maximum legal age for accessing ART. We argue that the question of setting a maternal age limit is related to the cultural context and is influenced by social representations of motherhood. The dominant discourses around the question of the necessity of an age limit are inevitably infused with social expectations. First, the arguments in favour of and against setting a maternal age limit will be analysed, such as reproductive autonomy, equality, the wellbeing of the child and her parents, the best interests of women, and the State's responsibility. Secondly, the principal models adopted in Western countries will be explored. Three models of normative frameworks can be identified: in the first, an explicit maternal age limit of eligibility has been set by law. In the second, such a limit has not been set explicitly, but 'soft' legal conditions, guidelines, and financial coverage restrictions have been introduced. In the third, no maternal age conditions have been stipulated at all. Thirdly, the possible grounds or explanations underlying these frameworks will be discussed. To this extent, arguments such as reproductive autonomy, nature, and the child's welfare will be analysed, as well as some political factors as pro-natalist policy and the issue of financial coverage. © 2017 The Author.},

Careful measurement attention to family formation is important because families are at the heart of numerous decisions, roles, and responsibilities with implications for understanding the well-being of families, adults and children. This paper considers whether there is a need for a new household panel study that addresses family formation. This paper consists of a review of the recent body of population-based, American surveys and finds a considerable gap in the ability to study the implications of families for the health and well-being of Americans. Earlier panel surveys used to assess family life anchored questions around marital events, but changes in family patterns require attention to a more diverse set of family forms. The paper concludes with recommendations for a multi-purpose panel study. The key challenge is to keep to pace with complexity and changes in American family life while at the same time maintaining a parsimonious set of survey questions.},

Stepfamily cohabitations are less likely to transition to marriage compared with nonstepfamily unions, especially among complex stepfamilies (both partners have children), but neither stepfamily status nor configuration affect dissolution. Shared intended and unintended births are associated with dissolution and marriage risks but largely only for nonstepfamily cohabitations, suggesting that shared childbearing is only indicative of the institutionalization for cohabitations that are not stepfamilies. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

	abstract = {In the period following the turn of the Century European total fertility rates (TFR) dropped to well below replacement. Work examining this highlights that cohort postponement in births contributes to low TFRs. It is generally recognised that women in more advantaged occupations often postpone childbearing in contrast to those in less advantaged occupational groups. However, relatively little research has been conducted on men in similar terms. This paper contrasts the timing of first birth by occupational class between men and women using individual level data in a case study of Scotland. The data are an extract from the Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS). This provides a 5.3% sample of the population of Scotland from the 1991 Census. The research applies the Cox proportional hazard model to estimate the speed to first birth during a period of observation between 1991 and 2006. Class is measured using NS-SEC 8 class analytic version. The model controls marital status, educational attainment, raised religion and urban-rural geography. It is found that 'career men' who occupy more advantaged occupational positions do not delay first birth in contrast to men in other occupational categories. This is in contrast to the well-known phenomenon of career women who have later childbearing. Our analysis shows that gender inequalities in how the social structure influences childbearing offer an avenue of explanation for wider patterns of social inequality. © 2016, University of Surrey.

We hypothesize that the birth of a child means an increase in the level of work–family tension, which may be substantial for some parents and relatively weak for others. To outline such an approach, we estimate fixed-effects models using panel data from the Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia survey. We find that childbearing negatively affects SWB only when parents, mothers in particular, face a substantial work–family conflict, providing thus support for our hypothesis. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Objective: In this study, we provide an updated report on differences in adult cohabitation rates during past decades, examine the risk factors associated with becoming a teen parent, and track teen parents’ educational and labor market outcomes until the age of 29 to examine whether the outcomes associated with become teen parents have changed in recent decades. Methods: We select two nationally representative birth cohorts in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) 1979 and 1997 (N = 9821). We use the difference-in-difference approach to examine whether the positions of teen parents have progressed or worsened across the two cohorts. Conclusion: The birth rates to teenage girls remained unchanged across the two cohorts, but the reported rates of teenage fatherhood increased. The proportions of both unmarried teenage fathers and mothers increased between the two cohorts. Teen fathers and mothers came increasingly from single-mother families with disadvantaged backgrounds. The proportion of teen mothers or fathers living with partners has not changed, but there has been a major shift from marriage to non-marital cohabitation. The education and earnings of the 1997 cohort of teen parents showed some progress relative to the earlier teen parent cohort, but no progress relative to peers who were not teen parents. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Demographic structures have undergone important transformations driven by economic cycles because of population movements and spatially-variable patterns of fertility and mortality. Understanding the latent relationship between changes over time in population structure and sequential waves of expansion and recession is a relevant issue in economic demography. In this regard, the recent history of southern European countries, and especially of Greece, is representative of consecutive economic expansions and recessions. The present study aims at investigating relevant modifications in population structure across Greek regions between 1988 and 2016 using a multi-temporal factor analysis. Being characterized by a relatively young population with traditional family structures, out-migration and moderate immigration up to the late 1980s, Greek demography shifted towards ageing, mononuclear families and a rising immigration rate during the early 2000s economic expansion, with an overall increase of resident population. The subsequent 2007 recession has represented a turning point in Greek demography, consolidating changes in traditional family structures, while stimulating out-migration to northern and western European countries and reducing immigration from developing countries. A diachronic analysis of population structures at sub-national scale indicates a substantial heterogeneity of demographic processes across Greek regions. Metropolitan areas and highly accessible coastal and flat districts including islands experienced rapid population dynamics, while peripheral rural regions underwent a moderate population ageing. Taken together, these processes had a short-term, synergic impact on Greek demographic structure determining a rapid increase in the median population age with possibly negative consequences for the ability of the country's economy to recover from crisis. © 2018, Editura Universitatii din Bucuresti.

The authors compare retrospective reports to benchmark panel survey estimates for the same cohorts. Sociodemographic groups—notably non-Hispanic white women and women with college-educated mothers— whose early employment histories at these ages are in aggregate more complex (multiple jobs) and lower in salience (more part-time jobs) are more likely to omit the occurrence of their first substantial job or employment and to misreport their first job or employment as occurring at an older age. Also, retrospective reports are skewed toward overreporting longer, therefore more salient, later jobs over shorter, earlier jobs. The relatively small magnitudes of differences, however, indicate that the retrospective questions nevertheless capture these summary indicators of first substantial employment reasonably accurately. Moreover, these differences are especially small for groups of women who are more likely to experience labor-market disadvantage and for women with early births. © American Sociological Association 2017.},

Based on Greek census data, the analysis generates empirical results in demographic areas that have yet to be fully explored, such as the quantum of completed cohort fertility by the partners' educational levels (particularly among homogamous, hypergamous, and hypogamous couples), permanent childlessness among highly educated couples and the completed fertility patterns by birth order across different educational pairings. The findings confirm the shift from the traditional pattern of educational hypergamy (women marrying up) to hypogamy (the woman is more educated than the man) and to medium and high educational homogamy. They also document that the differentials in fertility patterns by couples' levels of education appear to be related more to the tempo than the quantum of fertility, with the notable exception of the less educated homogamous couples; the completed fertility levels are significantly higher among this particular educational pairing than among the other educational pairings. The study suggests that educational pairing is likely to be an important topic in the investigation of human reproduction, particularly given that the increase in female educational levels and the shifts in traditional gender roles are leading to changes in fertility decisionmaking processes. © 2017 Verlag der Oesterreichischen Akademie der.},

	abstract = {Backround: More than downplayed, the role of men in the demographic analysis of reproduction has been entirely neglected. However, male fertility can be an important issue for exploring how economic and employment uncertainties relate to fertility and family dynamics. Objective: This paper intends to study fertility variations over time, relying solely on data referring to father's socio-demographic characteristics; in particular, their age, education level, and employment status. Methods: We use a combination of Labor Force Survey and Demographic Statistics data on population and Vital Statistics on births to estimate male fertility indicators and fertility differentials by education level and employment status, for the period 1992-2011 in Greece. In addition, over-time developments in male TFR are separated into structural (education-specific and employment-specific distributions) and behavioral (fertility, per se) changes. Results: We find that the male fertility level is declining, the fertility pattern is moving into higher ages, and the reproduction period for men is getting shorter. From 1992 up to 2008, changes in male fertility were mostly driven by behavioral rather than compositional factors. However, the decline of male fertility over the period of economic recession (2008-2011) is largely attributed to the continuous decrease in the proportions of employed men. Conclusions: The study suggests that male fertility merits further exploration. In particular, years of economic downturn and countries where household living standards are mostly associated with male employment, a father's employability is likely to emerge as an increasingly important factor of fertility outcomes. © 2014 Alexandra Tragaki and Christos Bagavos.},

	abstract = {‘Non-knowledge’ is a classical sociological term introduced into sociology most prominently by Georg Simmel. Dismissing classical sociological concepts as ‘zombie categories’, Ulrich Beck turned to non-knowledge relatively late in his career. This article argues provocatively that many of Beck’s observations on issues ranging from the uninsurability of modern risks to the notion of risk itself would have greatly profited from being complemented or even substituted by a theory of not knowing. Viewed in this light, Beck’s notion of risk no longer applies to the world he describes and thus has become one of his own zombie categories. The article then takes up some of Beck’s unfinished attempts at conceptualizing the unknown and develops them further so that they might prove useful for security studies and related fields today. To illustrate this approach, the article uses examples of non-knowledge on matters ranging from potential terrorist attacks to issues of human health and security. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

	abstract = {The majority of U.S. nonmarital births today are to cohabiting couples. This study focuses on transitions to cohabitation or marriage among pregnant unmarried women during the period between conception and birth. Results using the newly-released 2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth show that nonmarital pregnancy is a significant precursor to cohabitation before childbirth (18%), exceeding transitions to marriage (5%) by factor of over three. For pregnant women, the boundaries between singlehood, cohabitation, and marriage are highly fluid. The results also reveal substantial variation in post-conception cohabiting and marital unions; e.g., disproportionately low percentages of black single and cohabiting women transitioned into marriage, even when conventional social and economic risk factors are controlled. The multivariate analyses also point to persistent class differences in patterns of family formation, including patterns of cohabitation and marriage following conception. Poorly educated women, in particular, are much more likely to become pregnant as singles living alone or as partners in cohabiting unions. But compared with college-educated women, pregnancies are less likely to lead to either cohabitation or marriage. This paper highlights the conceptual and technical challenges involved in making unambiguous interpretations of nonmarital fertility during a period of rising nonmarital cohabitation. © 2014.},

Compared to parents or those desiring children, childfree respondents scored significantly higher in Independence and significantly lower in Agreeableness and Extraversion. They were also less religious and more politically liberal. For non-parents, level of desire for parenthood was negatively correlated with Independence and positively correlated with Agreeableness and religiosity. The ideal number of children desired was positively correlated with Agreeableness and religiosity. Childfree respondents who decided early in life not to have children (‘early articulators’) were significantly higher in Independence and Openness to Experience than those who decided later in life. Motivations for childlessness loaded onto five factors, four of which correlated significantly with personality traits.

Based on Greek census data, the analysis generates empirical results in demographic areas that have yet to be fully explored, such as the quantum of completed cohort fertility by the partners' educational levels (particularly among homogamous, hypergamous, and hypogamous couples), permanent childlessness among highly educated couples and the completed fertility patterns by birth order across different educational pairings. The findings confirm the shift from the traditional pattern of educational hypergamy (women marrying up) to hypogamy (the woman is more educated than the man) and to medium and high educational homogamy. They also document that the differentials in fertility patterns by couples' levels of education appear to be related more to the tempo than the quantum of fertility, with the notable exception of the less educated homogamous couples; the completed fertility levels are significantly higher among this particular educational pairing than among the other educational pairings. The study suggests that educational pairing is likely to be an important topic in the investigation of human reproduction, particularly given that the increase in female educational levels and the shifts in traditional gender roles are leading to changes in fertility decisionmaking processes. © Vienna Yearbook of Population Research 2017.},

	abstract = {Background: Postponing childbirth is becoming increasingly common in Western countries, especially among women with higher education. Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate female and male postgraduate students' attitudes toward parenthood, their intentions to have children, perceived obstacles to having or raising children during postgraduate studies, and their awareness of fertility issues. Methods: A 52-question survey was mailed to randomly selected postgraduate students attending a Swedish university. The questionnaire was developed based on earlier research by, and the professional experience of, the authors. Three pilot studies were conducted to test the questionnaire's reliability and validity. The t, x2, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used, as appropriate, to analyze responses. Results: Two hundred female and 200 male postgraduate students aged ≤40 years received questionnaires. The response rate was 71% (n = 141) among women and 58% (n = 116) among men. Most childless respondents had positive attitudes toward parenthood and wanted to have 2 or 3 children, and a majority of women wanted to have their last child after age 35. Compared with men, women were more pessimistic about the effects of parenthood on their postgraduate studies, and perceived more problems related to balancing work and family life. One of 4 respondents overestimated a woman's ability to become pregnant between 35 and 40 years of age, and about half had overly optimistic perceptions of the chances to have a baby by means of in vitro fertilization. Conclusions: Most postgraduate students wanted to have children in the future. More women than men perceived that having children while completing postgraduate studies was or would be difficult, and that parenthood would negatively affect their status in the labor market. Because many female postgraduate students intend to have children at an age when female fecundity is decreased, information on fertility issues would help them make informed decisions regarding family planning. © 2006 Excerpta Medica, Inc.},

In addition to providing a rich array of photographs, illustrations, tables, and a glossary of terms, this extraordinary textbook explores: Pregnancy and childbirth as a bio-cultural experience. Life-course issues related to gender identity, sexual orientations, behaviors, and lifestyles. Socioeconomic, political, historical, and ecological influences on sexual behavior. Early childhood sexuality, puberty and adolescence. Birth control, fertility, conception, and sexual differentiation. HIV infection, AIDS, AIDS globalization and sex work. Fusing biological, socio-psychological, and cultural influences to offer new perspectives on understanding human sexuality, its development over millions of years of evolution, and how sexuality is embedded in specific socio-cultural contexts, this is the text for educators and students who wish to understand human sexuality in all of its richness and complexity. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.

Within the scope of human senescence research, attention has been mainly focused on females, particularly in reference to the uniqueness of menopause. However, consideration of the evolution of human male reproductive senescence has been minimal, primarily due to the assumption that male fertility, as compared to that of females, is relatively invariant with age. Moreover, theoretical development of our understanding of human male reproductive senescence has not been extensive despite increasing awareness of the importance of life-history trade-offs in association with aging. Emerging research now illustrates important aspects of male reproductive senescence, exhibit significant variation and phenotypic plasticity, while others are less malleable. Changes in hormonemodulated somatic integrity with age also show important population differences, most likely as the result of reaction norms in response to environmental variation. Coupled with emerging ideas about the energetics of life-history trade-offs in human males, a new perspective is beginning to emerge. It suggests that human males exhibit potentially adaptive shifts in reproductive function in association with age. aging; senescence; male reproduction.},

	abstract = {Mammalian pheromones, audiomones, visuomones, and snarks-Richard Doty argues that they all belong in the same category: objects of imagination. For more than 50 years, researchers-including many prominent scientists-have identified pheromones as the triggers for a wide range of mammalian behaviors and endocrine responses. In this provocative book, renowned olfaction expert Richard L. Doty rejects this idea and states bluntly that, in contrast to insects, mammals do not have pheromones. Doty systematically debunks the claims and conclusions of studies that purport to reveal the existence of mammalian pheromones. He demonstrates that there is no generally accepted scientific definition of what constitutes a mammalian pheromone and that attempts to divide stimuli and complex behaviors into pheromonal and nonpheromonal categories have primarily failed. Doty's controversial assertion belies a continued fascination with the pheromone concept, numerous claims of its chemical isolation, and what he sees as the wasted expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars by industry and government. The Great Pheromone Myth directly challenges ideas about the role chemicals play in mammalian behavior and reproductive processes. It is a must-have reference for biologists, psychologists, neuroscientists, and readers interested in animal behavior, ecology, and evolution. © 2010 by The Johns Hopkins University Press.

	abstract = {A variety of approaches have been employed to assess the importance of women's education for their second or third-birth rates. Some researchers have included the educational level measured at a relatively high age in their models, whereas others have included current education. A few have taken selection into account by modelling, first-, second-, and higher-order birth rates jointly, with a common unobserved factor. The corresponding education-fertility relationships among men, however, has not attracted any attention. In this study, based on Norwegian register data for the 1964 cohort, a high current educational level for a woman is found to stimulate her second- and third-birth rates. Controlling for selection through joint modelling turns out to be quife unimportant, but the results are very different if the educational level attained by age 30 is included instead of current education. It is important to be aware of such sensitivity to the specification. of education. The corresponding effects for men are also positive, but not more strongly positive than those for women. These results may suggest that we should not take for granted that women's education generally reduces fertility, and that it does so because of higher opportunity costs for the better educated. However, it is also possible that a high current educational level is linked with modest aspirations for further schooling, which would tend to stimulate subsequent fertility, that it is partly caused by some individual, family or community characteristics that also lead to high fertility, or that it even to some extent is a result of plans to have a child fairly soon. These alternative interpretations are discussed.},

Since demographic and socioeconomic factors have long been documented to be influential on female fertility, this chapter investigates how men’s fertility outcome is differentiated by their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The chapter also contrasts the effects of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics on male and female fertility results. The central covariates applied in the analysis to measure demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are age, racial and ethnic composition, nativity, metropolitan residence, marriage, education, income and labor force participation. The chapter demonstrates how men’s and women’s fertility outcomes are determined by the above factors. Meanwhile, it highlights those demographic and socioeconomic covariates that are able to differentiate male and female fertility outcomes. Several important implications are drawn from the research. The discussion at the end the chapter also enlightens the reader how this current analysis helps to construct fertility theories of men by examining demographic and socioeconomic covariates. © 2011, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {This article presents the core methodological ideas and empirical assessments of an extended cohort-component approach (known as the "ProFamy model"), and applications to simultaneously project household composition, living arrangements, and population sizes-gender structures at the subnational level in the United States. Comparisons of projections from 1990 to 2000 using this approach with census counts in 2000 for each of the 50 states and Washington, DC show that 68.0 %, 17.0 %, 11.2 %, and 3.8 % of the absolute percentage errors are <3.0 %, 3.0 % to 4.99 %, 5.0 % to 9.99 %, and ≥10.0 %, respectively. Another analysis compares average forecast errors between the extended cohort-component approach and the still widely used classic headship-rate method, by projecting number-of-bedrooms-specific housing demands from 1990 to 2000 and then comparing those projections with census counts in 2000 for each of the 50 states and Washington, DC. The results demonstrate that, compared with the extended cohort-component approach, the headship-rate method produces substantially more serious forecast errors because it cannot project households by size while the extended cohort-component approach projects detailed household sizes. We also present illustrative household and living arrangement projections for the five decades from 2000 to 2050, with medium-, small-, and large-family scenarios for each of the 50 states; Washington, DC; six counties of southern California; and the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. Among many interesting numerical outcomes of household and living arrangement projections with medium, low, and high bounds, the aging of American households over the next few decades across all states/areas is particularly striking. Finally, the limitations of the present study and potential future lines of research are discussed. © 2012 Population Association of America.},

We have evidence of these effects in Western populations, but little information regarding this social mechanism in non-Western contexts. Furthermore, comparisons of mothers' and fathers' independent roles in these crucial intergenerational mechanisms are rare. This article uses measures from a 10-year family panel study featuring independent interviews with mothers and fathers in rural Nepal to investigate these issues. We test the association of specific attitudes, rather than broad ideational domains, about childbearing and old-age care with sons' subsequent marriage behavior. Our results indicate that both mothers' and fathers' attitudes have important and independent influences on sons' marriage behavior. Simultaneous study of both parents' attitudes reveals that gender-specific parenting contexts can shape the relationship between parental attitudes and children's behaviors. This crucial mechanism of intergenerational continuity and change is strong in this non-Western setting, with substantial implications for studies of intergenerational influences on behavior in all settings. © American Sociological Association 2012.},

This is largely a matter of convenience. Since maternity is generally easier to ascertain than paternity, at least when purely demographic data are used, it is most functional to focus on females. Also, the major rate-limiting steps involved in human reproduction take place in the female. Menarche and menopause place more-or-less unambiguous absolute outer boundaries on the period of potential reproduction of women. Men have no such clear-cut, readily accessible marker of puberty and no age when all men who reach it are unable to reproduce. However, in view of the joint participation of the sexes in reproduction, fertility variation cannot be fully understood without considering male factors. Several proximate determinants of natural fertility reflect male attributes that potentially affect the reproductive success of a couple. In the present study, we focused on the interaction of endogenous and behavioral determinants of male fertility, defined by demographers as the production of a live birth by a man's wife, in order to gain a fuller understanding of natural fertility in an African population still living at the subsistence level.},

	abstract = {American fathers are a highly diverse group, but the breadwinning, live-in, biological dad prevails as the fatherhood ideal. Consequently, policymakers continue to emphasize marriage and residency over initiatives that might help foster healthy father-child relationships and creative co-parenting regardless of marital or residential status. In Nurturing Dads, William Marsiglio and Kevin Roy explore the ways new initiatives can address the social, cultural, and economic challenges men face in contemporary families and foster more meaningful engagement between many different kinds of fathers and their children. What makes a good father? The firsthand accounts in Nurturing Dads show that the answer to this question varies widely and in ways that counter the mainstream "provide and reside" model of fatherhood. Marsiglio and Roy document the personal experiences of more than 300 men from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds and diverse settings, including fathers-to-be, young adult fathers, middleclass dads, stepfathers, men with multiple children in separate families, and fathers in correctional facilities. They find that most dads express the desire to have strong, close relationships with their children and to develop the nurturing skills to maintain these bonds. But they also find that disadvantaged fathers, including young dads and those in constrained financial and personal circumstances, confront myriad structural obstacles, such as poverty, inadequate education, and poor job opportunities. Nurturing Dads asserts that society should help fathers become more committed and attentive caregivers and that federal and state agencies, work sites, grassroots advocacy groups, and the media all have roles to play. Recent efforts to introduce state-initiated paternity leave should be coupled with social programs that encourage fathers to develop unconditional commitments to children, to co-parent with mothers, to establish partnerships with their children's other caregivers, and to develop parenting skills and resources before becoming fathers via activities like volunteering and mentoring kids. Ultimately, Marsiglio and Roy argue, such combined strategies would not only change the policy landscape to promote engaged fathering but also change the cultural landscape to view nurturance as a fundamental aspect of good fathering. Care is a human experience-not just a woman's responsibility-and this core idea behind Nurturing Dads holds important implications for how society supports its families and defines manhood. The book promotes the progressive notion that fathers should provide more than financial support and, in the process, bring about a better start in life for their children.

Methods: Data fromthe 2003 BolivianDemographic andHealth Surveywere used to estimatewomen'swanted and unwanted TFRs.Logistic regression analyseswere conducted to examine whetherwomen's, men's and couples'characteristicswere associated with use of any contraceptive method andmodern methods. Results: The TFRs for indigenous and nonindigenouswomenwere 4.3 and 3.1, respectively.Thewanted fertility rate for indigenouswomenwas nearly the same as that for nonindigenouswomen (2.7 and 2.6, respectively); virtually all of the ethnic difference in the TFRswas attributable to the ethnic difference in unwanted fertility.The proportion of women in need of contraceptionwas greater among indigenouswomen than among nonindigenouswomen (26% vs.19%).In logistic regression analyses, male fertility preferences explained only a small part of the ethnic difference in contraceptive use. Conclusion: Women's, men's and couples'preferences contribute only marginally to unwanted fertility, suggesting that structural factors act as obstacles to preventing unwanted fertility.},

Only with the recent public exposure of men's reproductive troubles has the health of the male body been thrown into question, and along with it, deeper masculine ideals. Whereas once, men's sexual and reproductive abilities were the most taboo of topics, today, erectile dysfunction is a multi-billion dollar business, and magazine articles trumpet male reproductive decline with headlines such as "You're Half the Man Your Father Was." The author looks at our world of plummeting sperm counts, spiking reproductive cancers, sperm banks, and pharmacological cures for impotence, in order to assess the true state of male health. What she finds is male reproductive systems damaged by toxins and war, and proof piling up that through sperm, men pass on harm to the children they father. Yet, despite the evidence that men's health, as much as women's, significantly affects the vitality of their offspring, the author also sees a society holding on to outdated assumptions, one in which men ignore blatant health risks as they struggle to live up to antiquated ideas of manliness. © 2006 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

	abstract = {This study contributes to a topic, which is located at the intersection of demography, sociology, and psychology and which is still rarely addressed by research. It deals with young men's motives and opportunities for aspiring to have their own children. We examine using a qualitative approach how men frame their decision-making, and which factors and individuals influence their intentions in this biographic transition. A multidisciplinary design was implemented both in the development of the research questions and in the analysis of the interview. We draw upon concepts derived from personality and social psychology as well as from demography and sociology in order to attain an adequate approach to the topic throughout the course of the study and to be able to interpret results from different disciplinary perspectives. We interviewed 30-year-old men from East Germany, most of them childless, using a problem-centered interview technique that was strongly inspired by ideas of WITZEL. Our interviewees were participants from a large medical-psychological longitudinal survey, which allowed us access to selective quantitative data and served as background information. A particular point of interest for our study was to examine the subject of men's desire for children in times of a massive, and still unexplained fertility decline in East Germany. Results show a large variety and variability within the stories of our respondents. We refer to different social-psychological theories (the Theory of Symbolic Self- Completion and the Theory of Planned Behavior) in order to understand how processes of motivation, intention-formation, and decision-making in men occur during this important biographic transition in times of societal upheaval. © 2003 Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung / Forum: Qualitative Social Research.},

Findings suggest that being born to unmarried parents increases the risk of offspring having a nonmarital first birth, net of various confounding characteristics. This intergenerational link appears to particularly operate via parents' breaking up before offspring are age 14 and offspring's young age at first sex. While the link across two generations in nonmarital childbearing is not accounted for by parents' socioeconomic status (measured as fathers' education), several mediating factors vary by socioeconomic background. Gender and race/ethnicity also moderate the intergenerational transmission of nonmarital childbearing. This research sheds light on the prevalence of, and process by which, nonmarital childbearing is repeated across generations, which has important implications for long-term social stratification and inequality. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Since Southern and Northern Italy differ for the institutional and economic setting, cultural orientations regarding the importance of family as well as fertility rates, also for Italy it seems reasonable to suppose that the latter are caused by both 'structural' and 'cultural' factors. We argue that South-to-North migrations could be an interpretative key of geographical differences in the timing and number of childbirths. In fact, migrants are socialized to different familiar behaviours, although they share with Northerners the same institutional and economic setting. We use data from the Italian Households Longitudinal Survey and apply event history models to Italian men's transition to parenthood. Our results show that North-South differences in the transition to the first child are largely explained by different levels and patterns of female labour market participation, while preferences could have a crucial impact in the transition to the second child, where migrants and Southerners are equally much faster than Northerners. We think that these results contribute to both the literature about fertility determinants and long-term consequences of migrations. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.

The chapter starts the analysis by longitudinally examining male TFRs and ASFRs as compared to those of females during the past few decades. Findings of this chapter echo the results shown in Chapter 4 that studies male and female fertility patterns in 43 countries and places. Several new findings also emerge based on examining the case of Taiwan, which will be discussed in a great detail in this chapter. When investigating the age-specific fertility differentials by sex, the chapter takes educational attainments into consideration. It discusses how education serves as a factor to differentiate male and female fertility. The final part of the analysis in this chapter moves to an examination of male and female fertility in 23 subregions of Taiwan in 2002. Theoretical frameworks explaining female fertility reduction are applied to account for male fertility changes in the 23 subregions. Results show that current fertility theories do not explain male fertility as well as they account for female fertility. It suggests that research exploring determinants of male fertility is warranted. © 2011, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

A theoretical framework on why men may model their father's behaviors is offered, as are implications for practitioners. Copyright © 2006 Alliance for Children and Families.},

	abstract = {Possibly the greatest challenge for an evolutionary explanation of demographic transition is the fact that fertility levels universally start to fall first among the well-to-do, well-educated, healthy classes, which can be explained only by some voluntary or at least adaptive action. The problem of how restraints on fertility could have evolved by natural selection has been tackled with group selection models as well as with stabilizing selection models. The latter model, which is critically discussed in this article, posits that some intermediate (rather than maximal) level of fertility is optimal for long-term reproductive success. Tests of stabilizing selection in human populations are rare, their results inconclusive. Here four sets of data are analyzed: they are samples drawn from the class of 1950 of the US Military Academy at West Point (cohorts 1923-29), retired US noncommissioned officers (cohorts 1913-37), and western German and eastern German physicians (cohorts 1930-35), all containing fertility data over two generations, and from European royalty (cohorts 1790-1939) containing fertility data over four generations. Deterministic as well as stochastic fitness measures are used. It is found that maximal, not average, fertility in the first generation leads to maximal long-term reproductive success. Also against prediction, no decreasing marginal fitness gains by increasing fertility can be observed. The findings leave little space for considering stabilizing selection as a plausible mechanism explaining the course of demographic transition but indicate instead that biological evolution today is as fast and vigorous as ever in human history. Even in large populations, all people living today may be the descendants of just some few percents-a much smaller proportion than generally believed-of the people living some generations ago.},

Such errors are not routinely measured and documented in survey reports. This study jointly investigates the rate of undercoverage, the correlates of undercoverage, and the bias in survey data due to undercoverage in listed housing unit frames. Working with the National Survey of Family Growth, we estimate an undercoverage rate for traditional listing efforts of 13.6 percent. We find that multiunit status, rural areas, and map difficulties strongly correlate with undercoverage. We find significant bias in estimates of variables such as birth control use, pregnancies, and income. The results have important implications for users of data from surveys based on traditionally listed housing unit frames. © The Author(s) 2013.},

Our analysis emphasizes the dynamic interplay between social structures and processes at the macro, meso, and micro levels while focusing on social psychological issues. We examine (a) the social, organizational, and cultural contexts for fathering, (b) fathers' social capital contributions, (c) the construction and maintenance of father identities, and (d) fathering as a co-constructed accomplishment. These foci draw attention to how father involvement is affected by race, gender, economic considerations and a father's relationships with his child's mother and others in the community. We also examine how reflected appraisals of others may affect how a man perceives himself as a father. Relying heavily on qualitative approaches such as in-depth interviews, discourse analysis, interpretive practice, narrative practice, and dramaturgy, we suggest a number of ways a sociological lens can inform our understanding of father involvement. © 2000 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

In this article, we use data from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort to examine the antecedents of nonmarital fatherhood, as compared to marital fatherhood. Overall, we find the strongest support across both data sets for education and race/ethnicity as key predictors of having a nonmarital first birth, consistent with prior literature about women's nonmarital childbearing and about men's early/teenage fatherhood. Education is inversely related to the risk of nonmarital fatherhood, and minority (especially black) men are much more likely to have a child outside of marriage than white men. We find little evidence that employment predicts nonmarital fertility, although it does strongly (and positively) predict marital fertility. High predicted earnings are also associated with a greater likelihood of marital childbearing but with a lower likelihood of nonmarital childbearing. Given the socioeconomic disadvantage associated with nonmarital fatherhood, this research suggests that nonmarital fatherhood may be an important aspect of growing U.S. inequality and stratification both within and across generations. © 2013 Population Association of America.},

For the most part, this literature deals with reproductive-related behavior and gender relations. Less explored is the issue of marital instability. Using national-level data, this study explores the factors influencing one indicator of instability, divorce in Ghana. The theoretical arguments draw on a number of institutional and noninstitutional factors that are believed to affect marital stability in sub-Saharan Africa. Our findings provide some empirical support for a structural determinist interpretation of divorce in Ghana. For instance, the incidence of divorce was higher among women from matrilineal (Akan) societies, and also among women who were urban residents. Regarding the respondents’ background measures, we found that previous marital history, the duration of marriage, religion, and parity (children ever born) were strong predictors of divorce in Ghana.

Current contraceptive options are largely intended for use by women (pills, intrauterine devices [IUDs], injectables, and implants), with condoms and vasectomy being the only two options for men. In many countries, contraceptive use tends to be in the woman's domain, in part due to the nature of the contraceptive.

We provide descriptive statistics on early fertility by age, sex, race, cohort, and data set. Because each data set includes birth cohorts with varying early fertility rates, prevalence estimates for early male fertility are relatively similar across data sets. Associations between background characteristics and early fertility in regression models are less consistent across data sets. We discuss the implications of these findings for scholars doing research on early male fertility. © 2008 Hynes et al.},

	abstract = {Illuminating the dark side of economic globalization, this book gives a rare insider's view of the migrant farmworkers' binational circuit that stretches from the west central Mexico countryside to central California. Over the course of ten years, Ann Aurelia López conducted a series of intimate interviews with farmworkers and their families along the migrant circuit. She deftly weaves their voices together with up-to-date research to portray a world hidden from most Americans-a world of inescapable poverty that has worsened considerably since NAFTA was implemented in 1994. In fact, today it has become nearly impossible for rural communities in Mexico to continue to farm the land sustainably, leaving few survival options except the perilous border crossing to the United States. The Farmworkers' Journey brings together for the first time the many facets of this issue into a comprehensive and accessible narrative: how corporate agribusiness operates, how binational institutions and laws promote the subjugation of Mexican farmworkers, how migration affects family life, how genetically modified corn strains pouring into Mexico from the United States are affecting farmers, how migrants face exploitation from employers, and more. A must-read for all Americans, The Farmworkers' Journey traces the human consequences of our policy decisions. © 2007 by The Regents of the University of California.},

We link micro-information from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (GSOEP) with district-level data to estimate discrete-time multilevel logit models. Our results support the widely accepted idea about the importance of men's individual economic status in marital decisions. They furthermore indicate a negative relationship between women's aggregate labor force participation and male transition rates to marriage, which could be interpreted as evidence for the popular 'economic independence hypothesis' of marital behavior. Complementary, we put forward an interpretation of female employment rates as indicators of a region's degree of secularization, for example. Consistent with a previous study on female nuptiality in Germany, our findings (which also include a significant latent contextual effect) suggest that a man's propensity to marry is influenced by the regional socio-cultural milieu he lives in. © 2002 Max-Planck-Gesellschaft.},

Taking into account the growing diversity of life course and residency patterns for men and children today, we stress how the definition of fatherhood and conceptualization of paternal involvement are interwoven. As our starting point, we highlight how diverse stakeholders construct differing images and types of fatherhood during an era when men are “doing fatherhood” in a wide range of contexts. Next, we explore issues associated with a broad conceptualization of father involvement, influence, and motivation with an eye toward fatherhood diversity. We then consider how several family processes are implicated in the way men develop, negotiate, and sustain their rights, privileges, and obligations as fathers in different types of family structures. We conclude by suggesting how our treatment of these issues can guide future research on fatherhood. © 2000 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.},

In the era of British world supremacy, these descendants formed the uppermost layer of the European aristocracy, occupying all royal thrones from 1850 onward.

This design controls for genetics, socioeconomic status, parity, social support, child mortality, birth cohort, and various environmental factors.

In this article, I use data from the Current Population Survey Fertility Supplements (1995, 1998, 2004, 2008) and logistic regression and regression-based decomposition techniques to assess the contribution of changes in educational attainment, marriage behavior, and racial/ethnic composition on population levels of childlessness in the United States. Results show that increases in the proportion of women unmarried by age 40 contributed most to the increase in childlessness in the late twentieth century, although these increases were offset somewhat by increased childbearing among unmarried women. The rising proportion of women with a college degree also explained a substantial amount of the increase in childless women. © 2013 Population Association of America.},

To fill these gaps, this study uses data from the 2002 NSFG Cycle 6 on religious affiliation, religiosity, and children ever born (CEB) for both men and women to investigate the effects of religious affiliation and religiosity on male and female fertility. A series of hypotheses which aim to demonstrate the critical role of religiosity, particularly the importance of religious beliefs in people's daily life in shaping people's fertility behavior are tested. The findings show a shrinking pattern of fertility differentials among religious groups. However, religiosity, particularly religious beliefs, shows a substantially positive effect on fertility.

The three measures of nonresident father involvement examined are father-child visitation, formal child support payments received through the welfare office, and informal child support, such as money given directly to the mother, groceries, clothes, or other items. Findings reveal that while only 16.6% of fathers provided child support through the formal system during the past year, a considerably larger proportion, 42.3%, provided informal child support, and 67% visited at least once in the past year. Informal support and father-child visitation are the most highly correlated forms of involvement, and they share many of the same predictors. Only two predictors are significant and in the same direction for all three measures of nonresident father involvement. Father's residence in the same state as the focal child and the provision of support for the child from the father's family are associated with a higher likelihood of his involvement. In general, findings for the child well-being measures show that monetary and material contributions from the father, especially contributions provided informally, are positively associated with more positive child well-being outcomes. © 2000 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

The authors investigate this hypothesis using a sample of young women from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, to which they add information on state child support enforcement. Models of the probability of a teenage premarital birth and of teenage premarital pregnancy and pregnancy resolution provide tentative evidence that during the early 1980s, teens living in states with higher rates of paternity establishment were less likely to become unwed mothers. This relationship is stronger for non-Hispanic Whites than for non-Hispanic Blacks. The findings suggest that policies that shift more costs of premarital childbearing to men may reduce this behavior, at least among non-Hispanic Whites.},

The chapter studies male fertility, measured by the total fertility rate (TFR) and the age-specific fertility rate (ASFR), as compared to female fertility in 43 countries and places during 1990–1998. Several important findings emerge from the analysis. The most important finding drawn from this chapter is that a TFR value of 2,200 or replacement-level fertility defines the correlation of male and female fertility at the aggregate level. The significance of this finding is discussed in a greater detail in the chapter. Moreover, the chapter exhibits that the male and female age-specific fertility differentials can interact with the level of total fertility. In terms of male and female age-specific fertility differentials, a greater fertility variation is shown to occur among females than among males at younger age groups. This result challenges the general statement of previous research that male fertility varies to a greater extent than female fertility. In the end, the chapter proposes several rationales to elucidate why male fertility rates differ from those of females in a variety of societies. © 2011, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Comparing fertility rates in each survey with population rates based on data from Vital Statistics and the U. S. Census Bureau, we document how the incomplete reporting of births in different surveys varies according to men's characteristics, including their age, race, marital status, and birth cohort. In addition, we use Monte Carlo simulations based on the NSFG data to demonstrate how birth underreporting biases associations between early parenthood and its antecedents. We find that in the NSFG, roughly four out of five early births were reported; but in the NLSY79 and NLSY97, almost nine-tenths of early births were reported. In all three surveys, incomplete reporting was especially pronounced for nonmarital births. Our results suggest that the quality of male fertility data is strongly linked to survey design and that it has implications for models of early male fertility. © 2011 Population Association of America.},

	abstract = {It has been called sperm, semen, seed, cum, jizz, spunk, gentlemen's relish, and splooge. But however the "tacky, opaque liquid that comes out of the penis" is described, the very act of defining "sperm" and "semen" depends on your point of view. For Lisa Jean Moore, how sperm comes to be known is based on who defines it (a scientist vs. a defense witness, for example), under what social circumstances it is found (a doctor's office vs. a crime scene), and for what purposes it will be used (in vitro fertilization vs. DNA analysis). Examining semen historically, medically, and culturally, Sperm Counts is a penetrating exploration of its meaning and power. Using a ";follow that sperm" approach, Moore shows how representations of sperm and semen are always in flux, tracing their twisting journeys from male reproductive glands to headline news stories and presidential impeachment trials. Much like the fluid of semen itself can leak onto fabrics and into bodies, its meanings seep into our consciousness over time. Moore's analytic lens yields intriguing observations of how sperm is "spent" and "reabsorbed" as it spurts, swims, and careens through penises, vaginas, test tubes, labs, families, cultures, and politics. Drawn from fifteen years of research, Sperm Counts examines historical and scientific documents, children's "facts of life" books, pornography, the Internet, forensic transcripts and sex worker narratives to explain how semen got so complicated. Among other things, understanding how we produce, represent, deploy and institutionalize semen-biomedically, socially and culturally-provides valuable new perspectives on the changing social position of men and the evolving meanings of masculinity. Ultimately, as Moore reveals, sperm is intimately involved in not only the physical reproduction of males and females, but in how we come to understand ourselves as men and women. © 2007 by New York University.

	affiliations = {University of Virginia, United States},
	abstract = {Marriage and fatherhood are important aspects of most men's lives, and they typically lead to predictable changes, especially when the two occur together. For example, research on fatherhood outside of marriage found that it has many of the same consequences for men five to ten years later in their lives that motherhood outside of marriage has for women. Men who become fathers outside of marriage go on to have lower incomes, less education, work fewer weeks per year, and have higher rates of poverty (Lerman and Ooms 1993; Moore 1995; Nock 1998a). Since unmarried men do not typically live with their children, why would premarital fatherhood have such consequences? The simplest answer appears to be that unmarried fathers have much lower marriage rates than comparable men who are not fathers (unmarried mothers, likewise, have lower marriage rates than women who do not bear children outside of marriage). That is, once they become fathers they are less likely to marry than are comparable men who do not become fathers. The implication is that a failure to marry might explain some of the negative consequences of unmarried fatherhood. Indeed, research shows that the major reason premarital fatherhood affects men's futures is because it makes them less likely to ever get married and more likely to cohabit instead. Men who became fathers before marriage but who subsequently married someone (the mother of their child, or someone else) resembled men who did not become fathers before marriage. In other words, marriage erased most of the negative consequences of premarital fatherhood (Nock 1998a; Waite and Lillard 1991). Even if the failure to marry is the primary reason that unmarried fatherhood jeopardizes men's futures, we are still left to explain why marriage has such effects. Marriage in Men's Lives (Nock 1998b) was an attempt to identify why marriage is generally beneficial for men. Some conclusions from that work set the stage for the following discussion: • Both sexes gain from marriage, but men are the greater beneficiaries. • Marriage improves men's economic, emotional, and physical well-being. • Anything that separates men from marriage is likely to limit their futures. • The benefits of marriage are greater when children are born to the couple. Marriage alone improves men's lives, but not as much as marriage combined with fatherhood. Fatherhood alone is likely to be costly to men unless it is preceded or at least followed by marriage. Unfortunately, men who become unwed fathers are less likely ever to marry. As a result, they are less likely to enjoy the benefits of marriage. Marriage occupies a less conspicuous role in black men's lives today than in the past. As William Wilson (1980, 1990) and Elijah Anderson (1990) have noted, fewer black men now marry. U.S. census figures (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1978, 1988, 1998, 2000) show that in 1977, seven in ten (69 percent) black men aged 40 to 44 were married and living with their wives. Ten years later, in 1987, the figure had dropped by thirteen percentage points, to 56 percent. In 1997, the figure had dropped another thirteen percentage points, when 43 percent of black men that age were married and living with their wives (in 2000 the figure climbed slightly, to 45 percent). Given the high rates of divorce and separation among African Americans, another perspective on the role of marriage is gained by considering the percentage of men who have ever married. Approximately one in ten black men (9 percent) is currently married but not living with his wife. Another 16 percent are divorced. In all, seven in ten (70 percent) black men between the ages of forty and forty-four have been or are currently married. Alternatively, one in three (29 percent) men this age have never married (U.S. Bureau of the Census 2000). As these figures show, marriage is the norm among African American men this age, although high rates of divorce and separation mean that large numbers are not currently living with their wives.

The initial program objectives were to enhance parental skills and work opportunities for fathers. Discussion group data revealed that additional obstacles to father involvement included conflicts between parents and substance misuse and abuse. Communication skills, anger management, alternative methods of coping with stress and increased activities for families were added to the program components in response to these needs. Future plans for strengthening community connections to expand educational, training and employment opportunities as well as increased outreach to families were based on additional assessment of interventions needed for successful co-parenthood. © 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

When analyzing the results of various studies of data at either the aggregate or individual level, one important issue is worth noticing: a large number of existing analyses on the reproductive process are based largely, if not entirely, on female fertility data, whilst men are more or less absent from data gathering and analysis. In this article, we focus on male reproductive behaviour mainly in the socio-demographic context. The first part of the paper deals with an overview of the existing theoretical perspectives and research studies in which male fertility and reproductive behaviour are considered. Further, we focus on the causes of researchers' low interest in male fertility. Finally, we present an inventory of indicators on male reproduction that are employed in research and also worth considering in future investigations. The present article aims to challenge other scholars to consider and examine male reproductive behaviour in the Czech Republic.},

In a landmark piece, he discusses the need for a new field of social aesthetics, further elaborated in his reflections on filming at an elite boys' school in northern India. The theme of the school is taken up as well in his discussion of fiction and nonfiction films of childhood. The book's final section presents a radical view of the history of visual anthropology as a maverick anthropological practice that was always at odds with the anthropology of words. In place of the conventional wisdom, he proposes a new set of principles for visual anthropology.These are essays in the classical sense--speculative, judicious, lucidly written, and mercifully jargon-free.The Corporeal Imagepresents the latest ideas from one of our foremost thinkers on the role of vision and visual representation in contemporary social thought. © 2012 by Princeton University Press.

Multipartner fertility, on the other hand, is positively associated with both disadvantage and advantage: higher-order birth risks with a new partner are more prevalent among men with low as well as high socioeconomic status. An intervening factor among disadvantaged men may be a higher union dissolution risk, and an elevated risk among advantaged men may be associated with their higher preferences for children and other features that make these men more attractive to women as partners and fathers of future children. © 2012 Population Association of America.},

Similarly, comparisons between older and younger individuals indicate that hypergamy becomes increasingly likely with age. Unfortunately, prior research has not been able to disentangle the effects of age from the effect of divorce. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort (n = 12,231 for first marriage and 4,298 for remarriage) and heterogeneous choice models, this research predicted the likelihood of age homogamy and hypergamy as a function of age, marital history, and other factors. The results indicate that homogamy is largely an age-driven phenomena, where the never-married and previously married have similar patterns. However, the likelihood of hypergamy is higher for the previously married, even after accounting for the influence of age in the models. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the specialization hypothesis, arguing that, if specialization causes the male marriage premium, married women should experience wage losses. Furthermore, specialization by married parents should augment the motherhood penalty and the fatherhood premium for married as compared to unmarried parents. Using fixed-effects models and data from the NLSY79, we estimate within-gender differences in wages according to marital status and between-gender differences in the associations between marital status and wages. We then test whether specialization on time use, job traits, and tenure accounts for the observed associations. Results for women do not support the specialization hypothesis. Childless men and women both receive a marriage premium. Marriage augments the fatherhood premium but not the motherhood penalty. Changes in own and spousal employment hours, job traits, and tenure appear to benefit both married men and women, although men benefit more. Marriage changes men's labor market behavior in ways that augment wages, but these changes do not appear to occur at the expense of women's wages. © American Sociological Association 2013.},

We analysed cross-sectional data obtained from a structured face-to-face interview with 1,373 respondents aged 15-50, who have ever had sex in Ibadan, Nigeria. Knowledge of HIV/AIDS, its route of transmission and prevention strategies was high. About 20 % of the respondents were exposed to the AIDS prevention campaigns. A majority reported sexual behavioral changes, which included restriction of sex partners, use of condoms, sexual abstinence and avoidance of casual sex. Thirtynine percent took some steps to reduce risk of infection by avoiding transfusion with unscreened blood and testing for HIV status. Using multiple logistic regressions, the factors affecting the reported changes were identified. The application of health belief model shows that the model cannot wholly explain the changes in behavior. The role of female powerlessness in safer sex decision-making is noted. Despite the limitations of the study, the need for a sustained AIDS prevention campaign is stressed. The implications of the study for AIDS programs and research are highlighted.},

This study examines the association between educational level and completed fertility in a sample of Finnish male and female twins born between 1950 and 1957 with register-based fertility follow-up until 2009. The results show that poorly educated men and highly educated women are least likely to have any children and have lower completed fertility in general. Behavioral genetics analysis suggests that the association between education and having any children in both sexes is influenced by factors shared by co-twins and that these factors are genetic rather than common environmental. No evidence of a causal pathway between education and having any children independent of these shared influences is found. These findings suggest that familial factors may play a role in the process through which educational differences in completed fertility are formed. © 2013 Population Association of America.},

In most countries, the alienation of men from participation in these programs was subsequently identified as one of the major causes, a finding that led researchers to redirect their attention to couples instead of individuals as the focus of such programs. Lack of spousal communication about family planning was identified as one reason for the low level of contraceptive use among women. Subsequent research has persistently demonstrated a positive relationship between spousal communication and contraceptive use. Most prior studies on this topic have been based on cross-sectional data, so that whether the identified relationship are causal remains unclear. Does communication, in fact, predict contraceptive use, or does the use of contraceptives generate communication among couples? This study addresses the question of causality by using longitudinal data from the Navrongo Health Research Centre panel survey. Results from both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis demonstrate that spousal communication does, indeed, predict contraceptive behavior, even when other factors are controlled.},

Early maternal characteristics shaped the later family environment of adolescents (parenting quality and home environment), which, in turn, was associated with the attitudes and behaviors of teens that put them at risk of a nonmarital birth. Notably, there was variation in some of the associations by gender. Increased mother's cognitive ability lowered the risk of a nonmarital birth for boys, but not for girls, whereas fertility expectations were significant for girls, but not for boys.

However, migration between rural and urban areas has resulted in the spread of the virus to all segments of the population. Prevention efforts continue to focus on the ABCs of AIDS, namely, abstinence among young adults, being faithful within a monogamous relationship, and/or using condoms at each sexual encounter. We examine the effects of residence, migration status, and selected social and demographic variables on the use of these three practices among men in Zimbabwe, a nation experiencing one of the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rates in the world. Both residence and migration status were found to be significantly related to safe sex practices. Knowledge of a source with easy access to condoms was the strongest predictor of this behavior. Knowledge of prevention methods and experience with persons with AIDS also exerted significant effects, although not always in the manner hypothesized. Possible reasons for the findings and implications for policy are discussed. Copyright © 2006 by the Rural Sociological Society.},

	abstract = {Different kinds of biological effects of mobile telephony radiation have been already confirmed by different experimenters, while a lot of contradictory results are also reported. In spite of any uncertainty, some of the recent results reporting effects show a distinct agreement between them, although with different biological models and under different laboratory conditions. Such results of exceptional importance and mutual similarity are those reporting DNA damage or oxidative stress induction on reproductive cells of different organisms, resulting in decreased fertility and reproduction. This distinct similarity among results of different experimental studies makes unlikely the possibility that these results could be wrong. This chapter analyzes and resumes our experimental findings of DNA damage on insect reproductive cells by Global System for Mobile telecommunications (GSM) radiations, compares them with similar recent results on mammalian - human infertility and discusses the possible connection between these findings and other reports regarding tumour induction, symptoms of unwellness, or declinations of bird and insect populations. A possible biochemical explanation of the reported effects at the cellular level is attempted. Since microwave radiations are non-ionizing and therefore unable to break chemical bonds, indirect ways of DNA damage are discussed, through enhancement of free radical and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, or irregular release of hydrolytic enzymes. Such events can be initiated by alterations of intracellular ionic concentrations after irregular gating of electrosensitive channels on the cell membranes according to the Ion Forced-Vibration mechanism that we have previously proposed. This biophysical mechanism seems to be realistic, since it is able to explain all of the reported biological effects associated with electromagnetic fields (EMFs) exposure, including the so-called "windows" of increased bioactivity reported since many years but remained unexplained so far, and recorded also in our recent experiments in regards to GSM radiation exposure. The chapter discusses also, an important dosimetry issue, regarding the use of Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), a quantity introduced to describe temperature increases within biological tissue (thermal effects), while the vast majority of the recorded biological effects are non-thermal. Finally the chapter attempts to propose so basic precautions and a different way of mobile telephony base station antennas network design, in order to minimize the exposure of human population and reduce significantly the current exposure limits in order to account for the reported non thermal biological effects. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {The idea of rural women as risk-averse food producers has been powerful and persistent and constitutes one of our most enduring generalizations. This contribution begins with some critical thoughts about the prevalent consensus on women and risk behaviour and goes on to discuss some counter examples of risk-taking women farmers in Zimbabwe and Zambia. It argues that risk behaviours of these kinds are strongly related to the character of marriage and forms of conjugality, and considers more broadly how insurance and dependence are gendered. There is a danger of overdrawing, and exclusively emphasizing, household and marriage as sites of gender subordination and thereby losing sight of the value to women of domestic groups and the existence of class-based solidarities and emotional investments, across gender, which are intertwined with gender subordinations. To recognize these (and other) positive aspects of institutions of kinship and marriage, without simultaneously endorsing subordination, requires a focus on change and women's agency within such institutions, and the happy thought that there is no such thing as the status quo. This study therefore considers myths made within different but overlapping contexts; first the idea of women as reliably risk averse (as well as disadvantaged in access to insurance) which holds sway in international development organizations and some gender analysis; and second, the myth of households as composed of entirely separate individuals with opposed gender interests, in which marriage is predominantly a contract legitimating the exploitation of women. Marriage works as a safety net for women in many contexts, as a form of insurance, but it may become an impediment to accumulation - a feature shared with other social security institutions. © Institute of Social Studies 2007.},

	abstract = {Donor conception has been practised for many years, initially as a means of bypassing male fertility problems through the use of donated semen. More recently, semen donation has provided a means by which a single woman and women in same sex relationships may build a family without engaging in penetrative heterosexual intercourse, while embryo and egg donation have provided new family-building opportunities for other groups, such as post-menopausal women. A key topic of debate, policy formulation, and regulation has been the extent to which donor-conceived people should be enabled to ascertain information about their genetic and biographical history. Currently, a minority of jurisdictions allow donor-conceived individuals to learn the identity of their donor. This article examines relevant provisions in these jurisdictions, identifying their similarities and differences, and outlines further measures that can be taken to promote the ability of donor-conceived people to learn about their genetic and biographical history.},

	abstract = {Past research that asserts a fatherhood wage premium often ignores the heterogeneity of fathering contexts. I expect fatherhood to produce wage gains for men if it prompts them to alter their behavior in ways that increase labor-market productivity. Identity theory predicts a larger productivity-based fatherhood premium when ties of biology, coresidence with the child, and marriage to the child's mother reinforce one another, making fatherhood, and the role of financial provider in particular, salient, high in commitment, and clear. Employer discrimination against fathers in less normative family structures may also contribute to variation in the fatherhood premium. Using fixed-effects models and data from the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79), I find that married, residential, biological fatherhood is associated with wage gains of about 4 percent, but unmarried residential fathers, nonresidential fathers, and stepfathers do not receive a fatherhood premium. Married residential fathers also receive no statistically significant wage premium when their wives work full-time. About 15 percent of the wage premium for married residential fathers can be explained by changes in human capital and job traits. © American Sociological Association 2012.},

When examining the cohabitation effect on fertility, I incorporate race and ethnicity into the analysis and investigate the fertility differentials by gender due to cohabitation across racial and ethnic groups. In addition, the chapter takes the interaction effects between cohabitation and socioeconomic factors, family-background covariates and the proximate determinants into consideration when exploring the cohabitation and fertility relationship. By examining data from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) Cycle 6, the results show that cohabitation has a stronger positive effect on male than on female fertility through mediating with an individual’s family-background characteristics and the proximate determinants. In addition, non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics are found to share more similarities than differences as compared to blacks in the cohabitation and fertility relationship. The chapter discusses the mechanisms that may explain the fertility differentials by gender and across race and ethnicity due to cohabitation. It also highlights the implications drawn from this research. © 2011, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Implications for multi-level approaches to social work practice include needed interventions at both macro and micro levels that address poverty, housing and neighborhood stabilization, employment, child care, human capital development, health and mental health services, family and individual counseling, and parenting skills. Further research must focus on this specific population of "fragile families," including development and evaluation of effective policies, programs, and services.},

The aims of this article are: 1) to describe why men have attracted limited interest as subjects of such research; 2) to evaluate existing research on men's roles in developing countries; and 3) to suggest directions for future research on male reproductive roles. Men, once neglected, are now included in research on fertility but from a narrow, overly problem-oriented perspective. A review of the literature, however, raises questions about the adequacy of a problem-oriented approach. The authors argue that demography should focus on men not only as women's partners, but also as individuals with distinct reproductive histories. In situations, now increasingly common, where the links between marriage and childbearing erode, the differences in men's and women's reproductive experiences and the costs and benefits of parenting will become more salient for future research.},

Monthly bleeding was especially important to these women, since it provided reassurance that pregnancy had been prevented. Secrecy from partners was important to some, but not to the majority of women in the focus groups. Among the numerous obstacles to method acceptance identified were unwanted bleeding problems, partner's objections, fear that an irreversible method might produce intolerable side effects, concern that providers would insert a device without consent, fear of not being able to conceive quickly after stopping use and discomfort with having to interrupt intimacy or touch oneself to insert a method.},

	abstract = {Data from German sample surveys was used to compare male and female fertility by birth cohort from 1902-04 to 1959-61. The results indicated that prior to 1930 male fertility was higher, and there was a wide range between male and female fertility. The gap narrowed over time among males aged over 40 years, whose mortality declined markedly over time. There were differences in male and female completed fertility for all age cohorts. The war years had an effect on the sex ratio, and the result was a reduced number of births. The marriage market when there was a surplus of male partners yielded a smaller share of childless women and a larger number of births. Factors affecting reproductive potential were the age difference between spouses, the length of the reproductive life span, the sex ratio, male migration, cohort size, and female survivorship. Male and female models can never separately adequately explain true population development. Cohort estimates showed female fertility peaks for cohorts 1950-52 at 15-19 years, 1944-46 at 20-24 years, 1932-40 at 25-29 years, and 1932-34 at 30-34 years. Between 1965 and 1970 there was a baby boom. Completed fertility for cohorts declined from the early 1900s. Male fertility for all cohorts showed smaller rates for men aged under 25 years and larger rates above age 30 years compared to women. Age specific fertility rates for men for all cohorts fluctuated like female rates. Before 1928, men had more children. The decline in male fertility rates at ages 35-39 years ended at cohorts 1938-40. A declining trend in male cohort fertility was evident for all periods for men aged over 40 years. The 1902-04 cohort for men aged over 40 years was about five times as high as female fertility. By the 1929 cohort male and female fertility differences were minimal. Even when the sex ratio was in equilibrium cohort fertility of males and females may be different because not all people reproduce. The share of childlessness within cohorts depends on the scarcity of one sex, such as was evidenced in the shortage of males after 1945.},

	abstract = {Factors such as female fertility, male fertility, female survival rate, and male survival rate affect the replacement of the present generation by the next generation. This realization led to the formulation of the two-sex population model to replace the one-sex model based on age composition of females alone. In 1975 Rogers introduced the study of one-sex multiregional stable population. In 1987 Nath extended the study of multiregional stable population to two-sex cases. An alternative approach of incorporating the age structure of both the sexes, considering age difference of parents and making use of sex ratio(s), making certain assumptions on female birth rates of the regions constituting the multiregional stable population, was employed to obtain a few female birth models that become stable. In the 4 models the effect on the female birth trajectory was studies using: 1) constant age difference between the parents when the survivors of male cohort are obtained from male cohort; 2) variable age difference between the parents as in 1) ; ; 3) constant age difference between the parents when survivors of male cohort are obtained from survivors of female cohort; and 4) variable age difference between the parents as in 3). The analyzed 4 models consist of female birth models of a multiregional stable population reflecting the effect of constant/variable age difference of parents when survivors of male cohort are obtained from male/female cohort. Models obtained are neither ordinary one-sex models nor ordinary two-sex models. In all the models paternity linked maternity (PLM) function was obtained in place of simple maternity function of the one-sex model and net parenthood function of the two-sex model. With the help of the PLM function, forecasts on future births can be made. As data for PLM function can be obtained more easily than those for net parenthood function, it is expected that the above models will be more suitable for practical applications than the ordinary two-sex model.},

The paper then describes the Fatherhood Initiative, a set of activities that stemmed from a 1995 memorandum from President Clinton. This Initiative led to coordinated efforts by U.S. Federal Statistical agencies to collect better data about fathers. The paper concludes with a discussion of what we know about the effects on father involvement of policies such as welfare reform, child support, work place policies, responsible fatherhood programs, and other fatherhood interventions. Examples of new programs and initiatives on father involvement are also given.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of wives' and husbands' education, gender equality, and place of residence on children ever born. In 1984 the total fertility rate (TFR) in Zimbabwe was 6.5 births per woman and total contraceptive prevalence was 38%. By 1988-89 the TFR had declined to 5.5 per women and contraceptive prevalence increased to 43% among married women ages 15-49. The 1988 Zimbabwe Male Fertility Survey (ZMFS) provided the data on the Shona-speaking population, using a stratified cluster sampling design. 710 respondents were identified in each administrative enumeration area. The analysis was based on an unweighted subsample of respondents in the 11 rural, rural commercial, and urban enumeration areas and limited to wives in the 15-49 age group, yielding 457 people. Also 423 husbands with one wife were included, but the final sample was 393 after exclusions. All information gathered in the survey was obtained from male respondents, i.e., husbands. The reproductive age group of 15-49 was divided into equal age groupings of 15-29 and 30-49 with 182 and 211 couples respectively in the multiple regression analysis. Three models were estimated for each age group by successively adding variables. The effects of age and GENDEX (the gender equality index) were estimated, then the two dummy residence variables were added, and finally the two education variables were included. The 3 residence types for the 15-49 age group showed significant differences for GENDEX and both wives' and husbands' education. GENDEX significantly increased from rural to high density and from high density to middle class residences. In all age groups the independent variables of GENDEX, MIDCLASS and wife's education had a significant and negative influence on children ever born. In the 30-49 age group the overall mean was 5.6 children compared to 6.4 children ever born for the 40-49 age group. In the future primarily female education but also urban residence, gender equality, and husbands' education will have negative consequences on fertility.},

Analysis has revealed that contraceptive use among women is quite low. Women's age, marital status, educational level, and place of residence are some of the factors that relate significantly to contraceptive use. The reasons most frequently cited for non-use of a modern birth control method are the desire to have children, lack of knowledge, and health concerns. The data show little motivation among women to practice family planning. Suggestions for effective family planning are provided. © 1999 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this report is to describe knowledge, attitudes, and practices in family planning among the male Zimbabweans. Understanding the role of men in inhibiting or promoting contraceptive adoption could affect the design of family planning promotion programs and program success in Zimbabwe and other African countries. Data from the 1988 Male Fertility Survey, a representive sample of 711 currently married men aged 20 and over, showed that men have a major role in the decision to use family planning methods and in determining the number of children a couple should have. Male knowledge of various family planning methods was high, as was approval and ever-use of family planning. Attitudes toward family planning information, obtaining methods, couple communication, and family size were also investigated. It was concluded that men should be included in information, education, and communication programs, without delay. Program efforts should move beyond emphasis on child spacing to stress family size limitation in order to increase contraceptive prevalence, resulting in a commensurate decline in the level of fertility. -Authors},

Fertility and KAP data obtained from men are presented, and, using present family size as an index of male fertility, fertility differences within and among race-religion-class groups are examined. When present family size means are compared among race-religion-class groups, dichotomized either on a knowledge variable or use variable, no specific patterns of differential fertility can be discerned. But the employment of a motivation variable results in a definite pattern: in each race-religion-class group, the mean present family size of the high-motivation sector is significantly smaller than that of the sector characterized by low motivation. Motivation seems, moreover, to be a better predictor of excess fertility than knowledgibility or use. A person so motivated that he experiences no more than one unplanned pregnancy is not likely to exceed his desired family size. Furthermore, this type of motivation does not seem to be confined to any one race, class, or religion. © 1968 Population Association of America.},

Next, we identify those characteristics that distinguish the fathers with high levels of concern from those who are less concerned. The quality of the marital or partner relationship strongly predicts fathers' concerns. Fathers who have a history of living apart from their child, and who maintain a high level of involvement with that child, express the least amount of concern. In addition, we find that the salience of the father role predicts concerns but that this effect varies according to the fathers' current age.},

Such information can be obtained either where questions about parental survival have been asked in two inquiries or by asking retrospectively about dates of orphanhood in a single survey. Although the method is somewhat sensitive to errors in the reporting of ages and dates, it is a promising source of up-to-date estimates of adult mortality that are free from bias due to the underreporting of the orphanhood of young children ("the adoption effect"). © 1991 Population Association of America.},

Nonetheless, the research identified a small but important minority of progressive males who questioned traditional machista attitudes. In focus group discussions, more progressive males were frequently criticized by machista males. Individual in-depth interviews found that being able to question predominant machista values was related to having a meaningful relationship with a role model who promoted nontraditional gender roles.

In an attempt to bridge the knowledge gap between female and male fertility attitudes, this paper investigated four dimensions: 1) perceptions of population problems in Ghana; 2) attitudes towards abortion and family planning; 3) attitudes towards children; and 4) attitudes towards family size. In general, the findings indicate that (1) the majority of the males believe that Ghana's population is too large; (2) they agree that abortion should be legalized and made accessible to any woman who wishes to have abortion, but on the other hand, disagree with government's interference with the number of children a couple should have; (3) they have a positive attitude toward child-bearing; (5) they believe in continued reproduction until the desired proportion of boys and girls are obtained; (6) they do not agree that there should be a relationship between the number of children a couple bear and available family resources; and (7) they believe that an educated man should have as many children as possible even though educational status is found to be inversely related to number of children, ideal number of children, and ideal number of female children. Implications of the findings and future research issues are discussed. © 1994, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The low utilization of family planning methods in Ghana, and by inference in much of Africa, is explained by reference to traditional sociocultural values held by males. A LISREL model is tested using data collected from educated males working in the Ghanaian government. Among the findings are that lack of couple communication, segregated conjugal role relationships, and male-dominated decision-making are all significant predictors of non-use of family planning methods (pronatalist attitude is not). Possession of knowledge of family planning among Ghanaian males alone is unlikely to initiate use of family planning methods. Additional sociodemographic and modernization findings are reported.},

Despite the volume of work on the roles men play in fertility decisions, there have been few attempts to derive direct empirical estimates of the effect of men's preferences on reproductive behavior. I employ 1989 and 1993 Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys to examine the relative roles of the reproductive preferences of males and females on contraceptive use. Additive and interactive measures of preferences document a significant effect of men's preferences, which may eclipse women's preferences. The implications of these findings are discussed.},

I propose a novel marriage categorization based on married men's intentions to take another wife. The three marriage groups are currently monogamous men who intend to remain so, currently monogamous men who intend to become polygynous, and currently polygynous men. The first analysis demonstrates that typical marriage analyses may misclassify men who intend to become polygynous. Applications of the marriage trichotomy illustrate that men with varying marital intentions have differing desires regarding fertility and family planning. © 1995 Population Association of America.},

	abstract = {This article investigates the fertility of Danish twins born during the periods 1870-1910 and 1953-64 in order to pursue two central questions for understanding human reproduction: Do genetic dispositions influence fertility and fertility-related behavior? Does the relevance of the 'nature versus nurture' debate shift over time or with demographic regimes? The authors find that genetic influences on fertility exist, but that their relative magnitude and pattern are contingent on gender and on the socioeconomic environment experienced by cohorts. Among females born in 1880-90 and after 1955, about 30-50 percent of the variance in fertility is due to genetic influences; these influences are substantially smaller for earlier and for interim birth cohorts. Male fertility is generally subject to smaller genetic and larger shared-environment effects than female fertility. Because genetic effects are most prevalent in situations with deliberately controlled fertility and relatively egalitarian socioeconomic opportunities, the authors propose that the genetic dispositions affect primarily fertility behavior and motivations for having children. Analyses of fertility motivations, measured by age of first attempt to have a child, support this interpretation.},
